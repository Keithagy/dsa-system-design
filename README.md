# leetcode-practice

All my leetcode practice, indexed by problem, then language, then date.

## Handy resources / references

- [Primeagean's The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-algos/lessons/introduction/intro)

## TODOs (i.e potentially fun ways to over-engineer this)

- Can I pipeline this to generate stats?
  - Problems I've failed and should retry?
  - Spaced repetition helper?
  - Dashboard of problems by language? By difficulty? By category?
