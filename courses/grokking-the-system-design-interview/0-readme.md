# Grokking the System Design Interview: Keith's Notes

Course materials are organized as a sequence of practice cases.
Each practice case is essentially a markdown document laying out one possible way to navigate the system design thought process.

Approach toward practicing:

- Before reading through each document, practice each case on your own
  - Learn how to apply the roadmap laid out in the step by step guide
  - Lay out the "uncertainty boundary", which essentially is the list of questions you would want to ask an interview if they were in the room.
  - Further, lay out the ways you can forsee the conversation playing out in each forseeable answer to the questions you have.
- Then, read the solution document and see if your questions were answered.
  - Did you address the same core concerns as those outlined in the solution document?
  - Anything you touched on that they missed? Anything they touched on that you missed?
- Make refinements to your thought process, then move on to the next case.
- Give youself about 45 minutes to do a case before referring to the solution document.
