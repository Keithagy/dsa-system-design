# How Partitioned Databases Remain Available During Rebalancing

Partitioned databases distribute data across multiple nodes to enhance scalability and performance. A common challenge in such systems is maintaining availability for reads and writes during **partition rebalancing**, which occurs when data is redistributed across nodes due to scaling operations or node failures. This explanation explores the mechanisms that enable continuous availability during rebalancing, the fundamental principles behind them, and the role (if any) of copy-on-write semantics.

## Mechanisms for Continuous Availability

### 1. Data Replication

**Principle**: **Data replication** involves storing copies of data across multiple nodes. This redundancy ensures that if one node is unavailable or busy during rebalancing, another node can serve the requests.

**Implementation**:

- **Synchronous Replication**: Updates are written to all replicas before acknowledging the client, ensuring consistency at the cost of higher latency.
- **Asynchronous Replication**: Updates are acknowledged after writing to a primary replica, with secondary replicas updated later, improving performance but risking temporary inconsistencies.

**Benefits**:

- **Read Availability**: Reads can be served from any replica, distributing load and improving response times.
- **Write Availability**: Writes can be directed to a primary replica or coordinated among replicas to maintain data integrity.

### 2. Consistent Hashing

**Principle**: **Consistent hashing** minimizes data movement during rebalancing by mapping data to nodes using a hash function in a way that requires only a small portion of data to move when nodes are added or removed.

**Implementation**:

- **Hash Ring**: Data items and nodes are assigned positions on a logical ring using a hash function.
- **Node Changes**: When a node joins or leaves, only the data between the node's positions in the ring needs to be moved.

**Benefits**:

- **Reduced Rebalancing Overhead**: Less data movement means rebalancing can occur with minimal impact on the system.
- **Scalability**: Easily accommodates dynamic scaling of nodes.

### 3. Online Rebalancing with Logical Indirection

**Principle**: Using a level of indirection (e.g., a partition map), the system can redirect requests to the correct nodes during rebalancing without interrupting service.

**Implementation**:

- **Partition Map**: Maintains mappings of data partitions to physical nodes.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The map is updated to reflect new data locations as partitions are moved.
- **Request Routing**: Clients or proxies use the updated map to route requests appropriately.

**Benefits**:

- **Seamless Client Experience**: Clients remain unaware of the underlying data movements.
- **Continuous Operation**: The system serves reads and writes throughout the rebalancing process.

## Role of Copy-on-Write Semantics

**Copy-on-write (COW)** is a strategy where the system makes modifications on a copy of the data, leaving the original unchanged until the new version is ready to replace it. While COW is effective in memory management and file systems, its direct application in partitioned database rebalancing is limited.

**Relation to Rebalancing**:

- **Data Snapshotting**: Some databases use snapshotting mechanisms resembling COW to create consistent views during data migration.
- **Write Isolation**: COW can help isolate write operations during rebalancing, ensuring that writes do not interfere with data being moved.

**Considerations**:

- **Overhead**: Implementing COW at scale can introduce significant storage and performance overhead.
- **Complexity**: Adds complexity to the system, which may not justify the benefits in the context of partition rebalancing.

**Conclusion**: While copy-on-write semantics can aid in maintaining consistency during certain operations, they are not the primary method by which partitioned databases remain available during rebalancing. The key strategies are data replication, consistent hashing, and online rebalancing techniques.

## Alternatives and Trade-offs

### Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

**Principle**: MVCC allows multiple versions of data to exist simultaneously, enabling concurrent reads and writes without locking.

**Benefits**:

- **High Read Availability**: Readers can access a consistent snapshot of the data without waiting for write operations.
- **Reduced Contention**: Minimizes lock contention between transactions.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Increased Storage**: Requires additional storage for multiple data versions.
- **Complex Garbage Collection**: Old data versions need efficient cleanup mechanisms.

### Pausing Writes During Rebalancing

**Principle**: Temporarily halt write operations to ensure data consistency during data movement.

**Benefits**:

- **Simplified Rebalancing**: Eliminates the complexity of handling concurrent writes during partition movement.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures strong consistency without conflict resolution mechanisms.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Reduced Availability**: Write operations are unavailable during the pause, potentially impacting user experience.
- **Not Scalable**: Not suitable for systems requiring high availability and continuous write access.

### Using Proxy Layers or Middleware

**Principle**: Employ a proxy layer to abstract the partitioning logic from clients, managing request routing during rebalancing.

**Benefits**:

- **Transparency**: Clients are insulated from changes in the partitioning scheme.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for more complex routing logic and easier implementation of rebalancing strategies.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Added Latency**: The proxy layer introduces additional network hops.
- **Single Point of Failure**: Requires making the proxy layer highly available to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck.

## When to Leverage Each Strategy

- **High Availability Systems**: Use data replication and online rebalancing to ensure continuous operation.
- **Read-Heavy Workloads**: MVCC and replication enhance read performance and consistency.
- **Dynamic Environments**: Consistent hashing is ideal for systems with frequent scaling events.
- **Resource-Constrained Systems**: May opt for strategies with lower overhead, avoiding COW or extensive replication.

## Summary

Partitioned databases maintain availability during rebalancing through a combination of:

- **Data Replication**: Ensuring multiple copies of data are available.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Minimizing data movement when nodes change.
- **Online Rebalancing**: Redirecting requests seamlessly using updated partition maps.

While copy-on-write semantics offer benefits in certain contexts, they are not central to the availability strategies of partitioned databases during rebalancing. Instead, the focus is on efficient data distribution and request routing to provide uninterrupted service.
