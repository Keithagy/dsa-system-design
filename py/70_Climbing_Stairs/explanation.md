Certainly! Let's explore different solutions to the "Climbing Stairs" problem, analyze their complexity, and provide visualizations where helpful.

Solution 1: Recursive (Naive Approach)

Let's start with a simple recursive solution:

```python
def climb_stairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    return climb_stairs(n-1) + climb_stairs(n-2)
```

Time Complexity: O(2^n) - exponential, as we're making two recursive calls for each step.
Space Complexity: O(n) - due to the recursion stack.

This solution is intuitive but highly inefficient for larger values of n.

Solution 2: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

Now, let's implement a more efficient solution using dynamic programming:

```python
from typing import List

def climb_stairs(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases
    if n <= 2:
        return n

    # Initialize dp array
    dp: List[int] = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1  # There's 1 way to climb 1 stair
    dp[2] = 2  # There are 2 ways to climb 2 stairs

    # Fill the dp array
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        # Number of ways to reach i-th stair is sum of ways to reach (i-1)th and (i-2)th stairs
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

    return dp[n]

# Test cases
test_cases = [2, 3, 5, 10]
for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Number of ways to climb {case} stairs: {climb_stairs(case)}")

```

Time Complexity: O(n) - we iterate through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(n) - we use an array of size n+1.

This solution is much more efficient than the recursive approach and works well for larger values of n.

Solution 3: Optimized Space Complexity

We can optimize the space complexity by observing that we only need the last two values:

```python
def climb_stairs_optimized(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n

    prev, curr = 1, 2

    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        # Store current value before updating
        temp = curr
        # Update current with sum of previous two values
        curr = prev + curr
        # Move previous value one step forward
        prev = temp

    return curr

# Test cases
test_cases = [2, 3, 5, 10]
for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Number of ways to climb {case} stairs: {climb_stairs_optimized(case)}")

```

Time Complexity: O(n) - we still iterate n times.
Space Complexity: O(1) - we only use two variables regardless of input size.

This solution provides the best balance of time and space efficiency.

Visualization:

To help understand the problem and the dynamic programming approach, let's create a simple visualization:

Recommendation:
I recommend learning and implementing the Dynamic Programming solution (Solution 2) as it provides a good balance of efficiency and understandability. It's also a great introduction to dynamic programming concepts. For interviews, you should also be familiar with the space-optimized version (Solution 3) as it demonstrates your ability to optimize solutions further.

The key takeaways are:

1. Recognize the problem as a dynamic programming question.
2. Understand how to build the solution from smaller subproblems.
3. Be able to optimize the space complexity when possible.

Remember, in an interview setting, it's often good to start with the naive recursive solution, explain its limitations, and then move on to the more efficient dynamic programming approach. This demonstrates your problem-solving process and ability to optimize solutions.
