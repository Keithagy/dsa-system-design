## Explanation: Generate Parentheses

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is fundamentally about generating all valid combinations of parentheses given a specific number of pairs. The key characteristics to note are:

1. We're dealing with a fixed number of opening and closing parentheses (n pairs each).
2. The output must contain only well-formed (valid) parentheses combinations.
3. We need to generate all possible valid combinations.

The crucial insight here is understanding what makes a parentheses combination "well-formed":

1. At any point, the number of closing parentheses cannot exceed the number of opening parentheses.
2. The total number of opening and closing parentheses must each be equal to n.

This problem falls into the category of backtracking and recursion. The key principle that makes this question manageable is the concept of building the solution incrementally while maintaining the validity of the parentheses at each step.

Pattern-matching wise, this problem is similar to other combinatorial generation problems where we need to explore all valid possibilities while adhering to certain constraints. It's particularly related to problems involving balanced structures or valid sequence generation.

### Test cases

1. Edge case: n = 1
   Expected output: ["()"]

2. Small case: n = 2
   Expected output: ["(())", "()()"]

3. Larger case: n = 3
   Expected output: ["((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"]

4. Maximum input: n = 8
   (Output will be large, we'll just check the length)

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def test_generate_parentheses(func):
    test_cases = [
        (1, ["()"]),
        (2, ["(())", "()()"]),
        (3, ["((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"]),
        (8, None)  # We'll just check the length for this case
    ]

    for n, expected in test_cases:
        result = func(n)
        if n < 8:
            assert set(result) == set(expected), f"Failed for n={n}. Expected {expected}, got {result}"
        else:
            # For n=8, we'll just check if the length is correct (it should be 14 choose 7 = 3432)
            assert len(result) == 3432, f"Failed for n=8. Expected 3432 combinations, got {len(result)}"
    print("All tests passed!")

# You can use this function to test your implementation like this:
# test_generate_parentheses(generate_parentheses)
```

### Solutions

#### Overview of solution approaches

##### Solutions worth learning

1. Backtracking (Neetcode solution)
2. Closure Number (Recursive)
3. Dynamic Programming

Count: 3 solutions (1 Neetcode solution)

##### Rejected solutions

1. Brute Force Generation and Validation: Generate all possible combinations of '(' and ')' and then filter out the invalid ones. This is inefficient for larger n.
2. Iterative Stack-based Approach: While valid, it's more complex and less intuitive than the recursive approaches.

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Backtracking (Neetcode solution)

```python
def generate_parenthesis(n: int) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    res = []

    def backtrack(open_n: int, closed_n: int):
        if open_n == closed_n == n:
            res.append("".join(stack))
            return

        if open_n < n:
            stack.append("(")
            backtrack(open_n + 1, closed_n)
            stack.pop()

        if closed_n < open_n:
            stack.append(")")
            backtrack(open_n, closed_n + 1)
            stack.pop()

    backtrack(0, 0)
    return res
```

Time Complexity: O(4^n / √n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

The time complexity is not straightforward to derive. It's related to the Catalan number, which grows as 4^n / (n√n). In the worst case, we might explore up to 4^n paths, but many are pruned. The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack depth and the space needed to store each valid combination.

Intuition and invariants:

- We maintain the count of open and closed parentheses separately.
- We can always add an open parenthesis if we haven't used all n.
- We can only add a closing parenthesis if there are more open than closed ones.
- The solution is complete when we've used n open and n closed parentheses.

##### Closure Number (Recursive)

```python
def generate_parenthesis(n: int) -> List[str]:
    if n == 0:
        return [""]
    ans = []
    for c in range(n):
        for left in generate_parenthesis(c):
            for right in generate_parenthesis(n-1-c):
                ans.append(f"({left}){right}")
    return ans
```

Time Complexity: O(4^n / √n)
Space Complexity: O(4^n / √n)

The time and space complexity are the same as the backtracking solution, as this approach generates the same number of valid combinations. The space complexity is higher because we're storing intermediate results.

Intuition and invariants:

- Every valid parentheses combination can be broken down into (a)b, where a and b are valid combinations.
- We recursively generate all possible a and b for different lengths.
- The sum of lengths of a and b is always n-1 (excluding the outermost parentheses).

##### Dynamic Programming

```python
def generate_parenthesis(n: int) -> List[str]:
    dp = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0] = [""]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            for left in dp[j]:
                for right in dp[i - j - 1]:
                    dp[i].append(f"({left}){right}")

    return dp[n]
```

Time Complexity: O(4^n / √n)
Space Complexity: O(4^n / √n)

The time and space complexity are the same as the previous solutions. We're building up the solution iteratively, storing results for all smaller values of n.

Intuition and invariants:

- We build solutions for larger n using solutions for smaller n.
- For each n, we consider all ways to split it into left and right subproblems.
- The final solution for n is built by combining solutions from smaller subproblems.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Brute Force Generation and Validation: This approach would generate all 2^(2n) combinations of '(' and ')', then filter out invalid ones. It's rejected because it's extremely inefficient for larger n, with a time complexity of O(2^(2n)).

2. Iterative Stack-based Approach: While this approach works, it's more complex to implement and understand compared to the recursive solutions. It doesn't provide significant advantages in terms of time or space complexity, so it's not recommended for interview settings where clarity and simplicity are valued.

#### Final Recommendations

The backtracking solution (Neetcode's approach) is the best to learn and use in an interview setting. It's intuitive, efficient, and demonstrates a good understanding of recursion and constraint satisfaction. It's also easier to explain and modify if needed. The other approaches, while valid, are either more complex (dynamic programming) or less intuitive (closure number) for this specific problem.

### Visualization(s)

For the backtracking solution, we can visualize the process as a tree:

```
                    ""
                  /    \
                 (      )  (invalid, pruned)
               /   \
             ((     ()
           /   \      \
         (((   (()     ())
         |      |       |
       ((()))  (()())  (())()
                        /   \
                    (())(()  (())())
```

This tree shows how we build the solution step by step, pruning invalid branches (like starting with a closing parenthesis) early on. Each path from root to leaf represents a valid combination.
