Certainly! Let's go through different solutions for inverting a binary tree, analyze their complexities, and provide visualizations where helpful.

Solution 1: Recursive Approach

Let's start with the most intuitive and concise solution - the recursive approach.

```python
from typing import Optional

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def invertTree(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    # Base case: if the root is None, return None
    if not root:
        return None

    # Swap the left and right children
    root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left

    # Recursively invert the left and right subtrees
    invertTree(root.left)
    invertTree(root.right)

    # Return the root of the inverted tree
    return root

# Test cases
def create_tree(values):
    if not values:
        return None
    root = TreeNode(values[0])
    queue = [root]
    i = 1
    while queue and i < len(values):
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if i < len(values) and values[i] is not None:
            node.left = TreeNode(values[i])
            queue.append(node.left)
        i += 1
        if i < len(values) and values[i] is not None:
            node.right = TreeNode(values[i])
            queue.append(node.right)
        i += 1
    return root

# Test case 1
root1 = create_tree([4,2,7,1,3,6,9])
inverted1 = invertTree(root1)

# Test case 2
root2 = create_tree([2,1,3])
inverted2 = invertTree(root2)

# Test case 3
root3 = create_tree([])
inverted3 = invertTree(root3)

```

Explanation:

1. We define a `TreeNode` class to represent nodes in the binary tree.
2. The `invertTree` function takes the root of the tree as input and returns the root of the inverted tree.
3. We use recursion to invert the tree:
   - Base case: if the root is None, we return None.
   - We swap the left and right children of the current node.
   - We recursively call `invertTree` on the left and right subtrees.
4. Finally, we return the root of the inverted tree.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).

Solution 2: Iterative Approach using Queue

Now, let's look at an iterative solution using a queue.

```python
from typing import Optional
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def invertTree(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    if not root:
        return None

    # Create a queue and enqueue the root
    queue = deque([root])

    while queue:
        # Dequeue a node from the front of the queue
        node = queue.popleft()

        # Swap the left and right children
        node.left, node.right = node.right, node.left

        # Enqueue the left child if it exists
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)

        # Enqueue the right child if it exists
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)

    return root

# Test cases (same as in the recursive solution)
def create_tree(values):
    if not values:
        return None
    root = TreeNode(values[0])
    queue = deque([root])
    i = 1
    while queue and i < len(values):
        node = queue.popleft()
        if i < len(values) and values[i] is not None:
            node.left = TreeNode(values[i])
            queue.append(node.left)
        i += 1
        if i < len(values) and values[i] is not None:
            node.right = TreeNode(values[i])
            queue.append(node.right)
        i += 1
    return root

# Test case 1
root1 = create_tree([4,2,7,1,3,6,9])
inverted1 = invertTree(root1)

# Test case 2
root2 = create_tree([2,1,3])
inverted2 = invertTree(root2)

# Test case 3
root3 = create_tree([])
inverted3 = invertTree(root3)

```

Explanation:

1. We use a queue (implemented with `collections.deque` for efficiency) to perform a level-order traversal of the tree.
2. We start by enqueueing the root node.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   - We dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
   - We swap its left and right children.
   - We enqueue the left and right children (if they exist).
4. This process continues until we've processed all nodes in the tree.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
Space Complexity: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case, this could be O(n) for a perfect binary tree in its last level.

Recommendation:
Both solutions are efficient with a time complexity of O(n). The choice between them depends on the specific requirements:

1. The recursive solution is more concise and easier to understand at a glance. It's a great choice for interviews or when code readability is a priority.

2. The iterative solution might be preferred in scenarios where you're dealing with very deep trees and want to avoid the risk of stack overflow from deep recursion.

For most cases, including leetcode-style interviews, I would recommend learning and using the recursive solution. It's more intuitive and demonstrates a good understanding of tree structures and recursive thinking, which are valuable skills in such contexts.

To help visualize the algorithm, let's create a simple React component that demonstrates the inversion process:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const TreeNode = ({ value, left, right, depth }) => (
  <div
    style={{
      display: "flex",
      flexDirection: "column",
      alignItems: "center",
      padding: "10px",
      marginTop: depth === 0 ? "0" : "20px",
    }}
  >
    <div
      style={{
        width: "40px",
        height: "40px",
        borderRadius: "50%",
        backgroundColor: "#4CAF50",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        color: "white",
        fontWeight: "bold",
      }}
    >
      {value}
    </div>
    {(left || right) && (
      <div style={{ display: "flex", marginTop: "10px" }}>
        {left && <TreeNode {...left} depth={depth + 1} />}
        {right && <TreeNode {...right} depth={depth + 1} />}
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
);

const BinaryTreeVisualizer = () => {
  const [inverted, setInverted] = useState(false);

  const originalTree = {
    value: 4,
    left: {
      value: 2,
      left: { value: 1 },
      right: { value: 3 },
    },
    right: {
      value: 7,
      left: { value: 6 },
      right: { value: 9 },
    },
  };

  const invertedTree = {
    value: 4,
    left: {
      value: 7,
      left: { value: 9 },
      right: { value: 6 },
    },
    right: {
      value: 2,
      left: { value: 3 },
      right: { value: 1 },
    },
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: "Arial, sans-serif", textAlign: "center" }}>
      <h2>Binary Tree Inversion Visualizer</h2>
      <button
        onClick={() => setInverted(!inverted)}
        style={{
          padding: "10px 20px",
          fontSize: "16px",
          backgroundColor: "#008CBA",
          color: "white",
          border: "none",
          borderRadius: "5px",
          cursor: "pointer",
          marginBottom: "20px",
        }}
      >
        {inverted ? "Show Original" : "Invert Tree"}
      </button>
      <div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
        <TreeNode {...(inverted ? invertedTree : originalTree)} depth={0} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BinaryTreeVisualizer;
```

This React component creates a visual representation of the binary tree and allows you to toggle between the original and inverted states. It helps in understanding how the tree structure changes during the inversion process.

To use this visualizer:

1. The tree is initially displayed in its original state.
2. Clicking the "Invert Tree" button will show the inverted tree.
3. Clicking "Show Original" will revert to the original tree structure.

This visual aid can be particularly helpful in grasping the concept of tree inversion, especially for visual learners or when explaining the algorithm to others.
