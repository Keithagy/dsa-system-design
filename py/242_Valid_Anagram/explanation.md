Thank you for providing the "Valid Anagram" problem. I'll present multiple solutions, explain their time and space complexities, and recommend the best approach to learn. Let's start with the solutions:

1. Sorting Solution

```python
from typing import List

def is_anagram_sorting(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the lengths are different, if so, they can't be anagrams
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    # Sort both strings and compare them
    return sorted(s) == sorted(t)

# Test cases
test_cases: List[tuple[str, str, bool]] = [
    ("anagram", "nagaram", True),
    ("rat", "car", False),
    ("listen", "silent", True),
    ("hello", "world", False),
    ("", "", True),
]

for s, t, expected in test_cases:
    result = is_anagram_sorting(s, t)
    print(f"s: {s}, t: {t}, Expected: {expected}, Result: {result}")

```

Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the strings. This is due to the sorting operation.
Space Complexity: O(n) for creating new sorted lists.

2. Hash Table Solution

```python
from typing import List, Dict

def is_anagram_hash(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the lengths are different, if so, they can't be anagrams
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    # Create a dictionary to store character counts
    char_count: Dict[str, int] = {}

    # Count characters in s
    for char in s:
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1

    # Decrement counts for characters in t
    for char in t:
        if char not in char_count:
            return False
        char_count[char] -= 1
        if char_count[char] == 0:
            del char_count[char]

    # If the dictionary is empty, all characters matched
    return len(char_count) == 0

# Test cases
test_cases: List[tuple[str, str, bool]] = [
    ("anagram", "nagaram", True),
    ("rat", "car", False),
    ("listen", "silent", True),
    ("hello", "world", False),
    ("", "", True),
]

for s, t, expected in test_cases:
    result = is_anagram_hash(s, t)
    print(f"s: {s}, t: {t}, Expected: {expected}, Result: {result}")

```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings. We iterate through each string once.
Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the string. In the worst case, this could be O(1) if we consider only lowercase English letters (maximum 26 characters).

3. Counter Solution (using Python's collections module)

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def is_anagram_counter(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # Use Counter to count characters in both strings and compare
    return Counter(s) == Counter(t)

# Test cases
test_cases: List[tuple[str, str, bool]] = [
    ("anagram", "nagaram", True),
    ("rat", "car", False),
    ("listen", "silent", True),
    ("hello", "world", False),
    ("", "", True),
]

for s, t, expected in test_cases:
    result = is_anagram_counter(s, t)
    print(f"s: {s}, t: {t}, Expected: {expected}, Result: {result}")

```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings. Counter internally uses a hash table.
Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the string.

Recommendation:
I recommend learning and using the Hash Table Solution (Option 2) for the following reasons:

1. Efficiency: It has optimal time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(k).
2. Universality: The concept can be applied in various programming languages and doesn't rely on Python-specific libraries.
3. Learning Value: It teaches important concepts like hash tables and character frequency counting, which are useful in many string manipulation problems.
4. Flexibility: It's easy to modify for different requirements (e.g., case sensitivity, handling spaces).

The Counter solution is the most Pythonic and concise, but understanding the hash table approach will give you a deeper understanding of the problem-solving process.

Visualization:
To help explain the hash table approach, let's create a simple visualization:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  BarChart,
  Bar,
  XAxis,
  YAxis,
  Tooltip,
  Legend,
  ResponsiveContainer,
} from "recharts";

const AnagramVisualizer = () => {
  const [word1, setWord1] = useState("listen");
  const [word2, setWord2] = useState("silent");

  const countChars = (word) => {
    const count = {};
    for (let char of word) {
      count[char] = (count[char] || 0) + 1;
    }
    return count;
  };

  const prepareData = () => {
    const count1 = countChars(word1);
    const count2 = countChars(word2);
    const allChars = new Set([...word1, ...word2]);

    return Array.from(allChars).map((char) => ({
      char,
      [word1]: count1[char] || 0,
      [word2]: count2[char] || 0,
    }));
  };

  const data = prepareData();

  return (
    <div className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto p-4">
      <div className="mb-4">
        <input
          type="text"
          value={word1}
          onChange={(e) => setWord1(e.target.value)}
          className="border p-2 mr-2"
          placeholder="Enter first word"
        />
        <input
          type="text"
          value={word2}
          onChange={(e) => setWord2(e.target.value)}
          className="border p-2"
          placeholder="Enter second word"
        />
      </div>
      <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
        <BarChart data={data}>
          <XAxis dataKey="char" />
          <YAxis />
          <Tooltip />
          <Legend />
          <Bar dataKey={word1} fill="#8884d8" />
          <Bar dataKey={word2} fill="#82ca9d" />
        </BarChart>
      </ResponsiveContainer>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AnagramVisualizer;
```

This visualization allows you to input two words and see a bar chart comparing the frequency of each character in both words. If the words are anagrams, the bars for each character should match in height.

Follow-up Question:
Regarding Unicode characters, we can adapt our hash table solution to handle them as follows:

1. Use a more general data structure: In Python, the `dict` can handle Unicode characters as keys, so our current implementation would work for Unicode.
2. Consider normalization: Unicode has multiple ways to represent some characters. We might want to normalize the strings before comparison (e.g., using `unicodedata.normalize()`).
3. Be aware of performance: With a much larger character set, the space complexity could increase, and hash collisions might become more likely, potentially affecting performance.

The core algorithm remains the same, but these considerations ensure it works correctly and efficiently with Unicode.
