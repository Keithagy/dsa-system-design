Certainly! Let's explore different solutions to the "Counting Bits" problem, starting from a straightforward approach and then optimizing it. I'll provide explanations, runtime and memory complexity analysis, and recommendations.

Solution 1: Naive Approach (O(n log n))

Let's start with a simple solution that counts the number of 1's for each number from 0 to n.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        def count_ones(num: int) -> int:
            count = 0
            while num:
                count += num & 1  # Add the least significant bit to count
                num >>= 1  # Right shift by 1 (equivalent to division by 2)
            return count

        return [count_ones(i) for i in range(n + 1)]

# Test cases
solution = Solution()
print(solution.countBits(2))  # Expected: [0, 1, 1]
print(solution.countBits(5))  # Expected: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]

```

Explanation:

1. We define a helper function `count_ones` that counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of a given number.
2. In the main `countBits` function, we use a list comprehension to apply `count_ones` to each number from 0 to n.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

- We iterate through n+1 numbers.
- For each number, we perform O(log n) operations to count the 1's (since each number has at most log n bits).

Space Complexity: O(n) for the output array.

This solution is straightforward but not optimal. Let's look at a more efficient approach.

Solution 2: Dynamic Programming (O(n))

We can optimize this using dynamic programming by utilizing the previously calculated results.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        offset = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if offset * 2 == i:
                offset = i
            dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset]

        return dp

# Test cases
solution = Solution()
print(solution.countBits(2))  # Expected: [0, 1, 1]
print(solution.countBits(5))  # Expected: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]

```

Explanation:

1. We initialize a DP array with n+1 elements, all set to 0.
2. We use an offset variable to keep track of the most significant bit.
3. For each number i, we can calculate its number of 1's based on a previously calculated value:
   - If i is a power of 2, we update our offset.
   - Otherwise, we add 1 to the result of i minus the current offset.

Time Complexity: O(n)

- We iterate through the numbers once, performing constant-time operations for each.

Space Complexity: O(n) for the DP array.

This solution is much more efficient than the naive approach and meets the follow-up requirements of linear time and not using any built-in functions.

### Intuition behind changing value of `offset`

Excellent question! The intuition behind this block of code is key to understanding the dynamic programming solution. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Understanding binary representations:
   First, let's recall how binary numbers work. Each bit in a binary number represents a power of 2. For example:

   - 1 (decimal) = 1 (binary)
   - 2 (decimal) = 10 (binary)
   - 3 (decimal) = 11 (binary)
   - 4 (decimal) = 100 (binary)
   - 5 (decimal) = 101 (binary)
     ...and so on.

2. The role of `offset`:
   The `offset` variable keeps track of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the current number `i`. In other words, it represents the position of the most significant bit (leftmost 1) in the binary representation of `i`.

3. Updating the offset:

   ```python
   if offset * 2 == i:
       offset = i
   ```

   This condition checks if we've reached a new power of 2. When `i` is a power of 2, it means we're adding a new bit to the left in its binary representation. For example:

   - When i = 2, we go from '1' to '10'
   - When i = 4, we go from '11' to '100'
   - When i = 8, we go from '111' to '1000'
     In these cases, we update our offset to this new power of 2.

4. The DP relation:

   ```python
   dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset]
   ```

   This is where the magic happens. We're saying that the number of 1's in `i` is equal to:

   - The number of 1's in `(i - offset)`, plus
   - 1 (for the most significant bit)

   Why does this work? Because `i - offset` gives us the number represented by all bits to the right of the most significant bit. And we know we can reuse this value because we've already calculated it!

Let's visualize this with an example:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader } from "@/components/ui/card";

const OffsetExplanation = () => {
  const examples = [
    { i: 3, binary: "11", offset: 2, dp: [0, 1, 1, 2] },
    { i: 5, binary: "101", offset: 4, dp: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2] },
    { i: 7, binary: "111", offset: 4, dp: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3] },
  ];

  return (
    <Card className="w-full max-w-md mx-auto">
      <CardHeader>Offset and DP Calculation Examples</CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        {examples.map((example, index) => (
          <div key={index} className="mb-4 p-2 bg-gray-100 rounded">
            <p>
              <strong>i = {example.i}</strong> (binary: {example.binary})
            </p>
            <p>offset = {example.offset}</p>
            <p>i - offset = {example.i - example.offset}</p>
            <p>
              dp[{example.i}] = 1 + dp[{example.i - example.offset}]
            </p>
            <p>
              = 1 + {example.dp[example.i - example.offset]} ={" "}
              {example.dp[example.i]}
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">DP array: [{example.dp.join(", ")}]</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default OffsetExplanation;
```

This visualization shows examples of how the `offset` and DP values are calculated for different numbers. Let's break down one example:

For i = 5 (binary: 101):

1. The offset is 4 (100 in binary), which is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5.
2. We calculate dp[5] as: 1 + dp[5 - 4] = 1 + dp[1] = 1 + 1 = 2
3. This makes sense because 5 (101 in binary) indeed has two 1's.

The key intuition is that for any number, we can:

1. Identify its most significant bit (using the offset)
2. Count that bit (adding 1)
3. Reuse the previously calculated count for the remaining bits (dp[i - offset])

This approach allows us to build our solution incrementally, using previously computed results to quickly calculate new ones, which is the essence of dynamic programming.

By understanding this intuition, you can see how this algorithm efficiently computes the number of 1's for each number from 0 to n in linear time, without needing to examine each bit of each number individually.

Recommendation:
I recommend learning and understanding the dynamic programming solution (Solution 2). It's efficient, meets all the requirements, and demonstrates a clever use of patterns in binary representations. Understanding this solution will help in solving similar problems and improve your problem-solving skills for bit manipulation and dynamic programming questions.

Visualization:
To help understand the dynamic programming approach, let's create a simple visualization using a React component.

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader } from "@/components/ui/card";

const CountingBitsVisualization = () => {
  const [n, setN] = useState(5);
  const [dp, setDp] = useState([]);
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const calculateDP = () => {
      const newDp = [0];
      let offset = 1;
      for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (offset * 2 === i) {
          offset = i;
        }
        newDp.push(1 + newDp[i - offset]);
      }
      return newDp;
    };

    setDp(calculateDP());
    setCurrentStep(0);
  }, [n]);

  const nextStep = () => {
    if (currentStep < n) {
      setCurrentStep(currentStep + 1);
    }
  };

  const resetVisualization = () => {
    setCurrentStep(0);
  };

  return (
    <Card className="w-full max-w-md mx-auto">
      <CardHeader>Counting Bits Visualization (n = {n})</CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-6 gap-2 mb-4">
          {dp.slice(0, currentStep + 1).map((value, index) => (
            <div key={index} className="bg-blue-100 p-2 text-center rounded">
              <div className="text-sm text-gray-600">{index}</div>
              <div className="font-bold">{value}</div>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
        <div className="flex justify-between">
          <button
            onClick={nextStep}
            disabled={currentStep === n}
            className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded disabled:bg-gray-300"
          >
            Next Step
          </button>
          <button
            onClick={resetVisualization}
            className="bg-gray-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
          >
            Reset
          </button>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default CountingBitsVisualization;
```

This visualization demonstrates how the DP array is filled step by step for n = 5. Each cell shows the index (top) and the number of 1's in its binary representation (bottom). You can click "Next Step" to see how the array is populated, and "Reset" to start over.

To use this visualization:

1. Click "Next Step" to see how each value is calculated.
2. Observe how the values are derived from previous results.
3. Notice patterns, like how even numbers have the same count as their half.

This visual aid should help reinforce the understanding of the dynamic programming approach used in Solution 2.
