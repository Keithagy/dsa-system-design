Certainly! Let's explore different solutions for the 3Sum problem, analyze their time and space complexities, and recommend the best approach to learn. We'll use Python with helpful modules and type hints.

Solution 1: Brute Force Approach

Let's start with the simplest (but least efficient) solution:

```python
from typing import List

def three_sum_brute_force(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(nums)
    result = []

    # Sort the array to handle duplicates easily
    nums.sort()

    for i in range(n - 2):
        # Skip duplicates for i
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue

        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            # Skip duplicates for j
            if j > i + 1 and nums[j] == nums[j - 1]:
                continue

            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                # Skip duplicates for k
                if k > j + 1 and nums[k] == nums[k - 1]:
                    continue

                if nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0:
                    result.append([nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]])

    return result

# Test cases
print(three_sum_brute_force([-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]))  # Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
print(three_sum_brute_force([0, 1, 1]))  # Output: []
print(three_sum_brute_force([0, 0, 0]))  # Output: [[0, 0, 0]]

```

Time Complexity: O(n^3), where n is the length of the input array. We have three nested loops, each potentially iterating through the entire array.
Space Complexity: O(1) if we don't consider the space used for the output. The sorting is typically done in-place.

This approach is straightforward but very inefficient for large inputs due to its cubic time complexity.

Solution 2: Two Pointers Approach

Now, let's look at a more efficient solution using the two pointers technique:

```python
from typing import List

def three_sum_two_pointers(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(nums)
    result = []

    # Sort the array to use two pointers technique
    nums.sort()

    for i in range(n - 2):
        # Skip duplicates for i
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue

        left, right = i + 1, n - 1

        while left < right:
            current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

            if current_sum == 0:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])

                # Skip duplicates for left and right
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1

                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif current_sum < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

    return result

# Test cases
print(three_sum_two_pointers([-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]))  # Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
print(three_sum_two_pointers([0, 1, 1]))  # Output: []
print(three_sum_two_pointers([0, 0, 0]))  # Output: [[0, 0, 0]]

```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. We have one outer loop and the two pointers technique in the inner loop, which is linear.
Space Complexity: O(1) if we don't consider the space used for the output. The sorting is typically done in-place.

This approach is much more efficient than the brute force method, especially for larger inputs.

Recommendation:
I recommend learning and mastering the Two Pointers approach (Solution 2) for the 3Sum problem. Here's why:

1. Efficiency: It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is significantly better than the O(n^3) of the brute force approach.
2. Space efficiency: It uses constant extra space (excluding the output).
3. Common technique: The two pointers technique is widely used in array problems and is a valuable skill to have.
4. Interview performance: This solution demonstrates good problem-solving skills and optimization, which are highly valued in coding interviews.

To help visualize the two pointers approach, let's create a simple diagram:

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 600 200">

  </style>
  <rect x="50" y="50" width="500" height="50" fill="#f0f0f0" stroke="#333"/>
  <text x="300" y="30" text-anchor="middle">Sorted Array</text>

    </marker>

```

This diagram illustrates how the two pointers approach works:

1. The array is sorted.
2. We fix one element (i) and use two pointers (left and right) to find the other two elements.
3. We move the pointers based on the sum: if the sum is too small, we move left pointer to the right; if it's too large, we move right pointer to the left.

Understanding this visual representation can help in grasping the concept and implementing the solution effectively.
