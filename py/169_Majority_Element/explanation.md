Certainly! I'll provide multiple solutions for the majority element problem, explain their time and space complexities, and recommend the best one to learn. Let's start with different approaches:

1. Brute Force Approach
2. Hash Map Approach
3. Sorting Approach
4. Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

Let's go through each of these solutions:

1. Brute Force Approach:

```python
from typing import List

def majorityElement(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    for num in nums:
        count = sum(1 for elem in nums if elem == num)
        if count > n // 2:
            return num
    return -1  # This line will never be reached if majority element always exists
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2) - We have two nested loops, each potentially iterating through all elements.
Space Complexity: O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space.

This approach is straightforward but inefficient for large inputs.

2. Hash Map Approach:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def majorityElement(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    # Count occurrences of each number
    count = Counter(nums)
    n = len(nums)

    # Find the number that appears more than n/2 times
    for num, freq in count.items():
        if freq > n // 2:
            return num

    return -1  # This line will never be reached if majority element always exists
```

Time Complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the list once to count occurrences and once to find the majority.
Space Complexity: O(n) - In the worst case, the hash map could store counts for all unique elements.

This approach is more efficient than the brute force method and is easier to understand.

3. Sorting Approach:

```python
from typing import List

def majorityElement(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    # Sort the array
    nums.sort()

    # The middle element will always be the majority element
    return nums[len(nums) // 2]
```

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - Dominated by the sorting operation.
Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n), depending on the sorting algorithm used.

This approach is clever and concise but not as efficient as some other methods.

4. Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:

```python
from typing import List

def majorityElement(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

    return candidate
```

Time Complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the list once.
Space Complexity: O(1) - We only use two variables regardless of input size.

This algorithm is the most efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

Recommendation:
I would recommend learning the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm (Solution 4) as it's the most efficient and satisfies the follow-up question of solving the problem in linear time and constant space. It's also an interesting algorithm with applications in other majority-finding problems.

To help visualize the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, let's create a simple React component that demonstrates how it works:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";

const BoyerMooreVisualization = () => {
  const [nums, setNums] = useState([2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]);
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);
  const [candidate, setCandidate] = useState(null);
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const reset = () => {
    setCurrentIndex(0);
    setCandidate(null);
    setCount(0);
  };

  const step = () => {
    if (currentIndex >= nums.length) return;

    const num = nums[currentIndex];
    if (count === 0) {
      setCandidate(num);
      setCount(1);
    } else {
      setCount(count + (num === candidate ? 1 : -1));
    }
    setCurrentIndex(currentIndex + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4 max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">
        Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm Visualization
      </h2>
      <div className="mb-4">
        <Input
          value={nums.join(",")}
          onChange={(e) => {
            const newNums = e.target.value.split(",").map(Number);
            setNums(newNums);
            reset();
          }}
          placeholder="Enter numbers separated by commas"
          className="mb-2"
        />
        <Button onClick={reset} className="mr-2">
          Reset
        </Button>
        <Button onClick={step} disabled={currentIndex >= nums.length}>
          Step
        </Button>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-4">
        {nums.map((num, index) => (
          <span
            key={index}
            className={`inline-block w-8 h-8 mr-1 mb-1 text-center leading-8 ${
              index === currentIndex - 1
                ? "bg-blue-500 text-white"
                : "bg-gray-200"
            } ${num === candidate ? "border-2 border-green-500" : ""}`}
          >
            {num}
          </span>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Current Candidate: {candidate !== null ? candidate : "None"}</p>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <p>
          Majority Element:{" "}
          {currentIndex === nums.length ? candidate : "Not yet determined"}
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BoyerMooreVisualization;
```

This visualization allows you to step through the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, showing how the candidate and count change as we progress through the array. The current element is highlighted in blue, and the current candidate is outlined in green.

Now, let's provide some test cases:

```python
def test_majority_element():
    assert majorityElement([3,2,3]) == 3
    assert majorityElement([2,2,1,1,1,2,2]) == 2
    assert majorityElement([1]) == 1
    assert majorityElement([1,2,1,2,1]) == 1
    print("All test cases passed!")

test_majority_element()
```

These test cases cover various scenarios, including the examples provided in the problem statement, as well as edge cases like a single-element array and an array with a bare majority.

To summarize, the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is the recommended solution for this problem due to its O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. It's an elegant and efficient solution that works by canceling out non-majority elements, leaving the majority element as the final candidate.
