Thank you for providing this interesting LeetCode problem. Let's dive into different solutions for the "Product of Array Except Self" problem, analyze their complexities, and visualize the algorithm.

Solution 1: Two-pass approach (Left and Right products)

This solution uses two passes through the array to compute the product of all elements to the left and right of each element.

```python
from typing import List

def productExceptSelf(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(nums)
    answer = [1] * n  # Initialize the answer array with 1s

    # First pass: Compute left products
    left_product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        answer[i] = left_product  # Store the product of all elements to the left
        left_product *= nums[i]  # Update left_product for the next iteration

    # Second pass: Compute right products and multiply with left products
    right_product = 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        answer[i] *= right_product  # Multiply with the product of all elements to the right
        right_product *= nums[i]  # Update right_product for the next iteration

    return answer

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [-1, 1, 0, -3, 3]
]

for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {productExceptSelf(case)}")
    print()

```

Explanation:

1. We initialize the `answer` array with 1s.
2. In the first pass, we compute the product of all elements to the left of each element.
3. In the second pass, we compute the product of all elements to the right and multiply it with the left products.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
Space Complexity: O(1) extra space (excluding the output array).

This solution is efficient and meets all the requirements of the problem, including not using division and running in O(n) time.

To visualize this algorithm, let's create a simple React component that demonstrates how the algorithm works step by step.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const ProductExceptSelfVisualization = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);

  const productExceptSelf = (nums) => {
    const n = nums.length;
    const answer = new Array(n).fill(1);
    let leftProduct = 1;
    let rightProduct = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      answer[i] = leftProduct;
      leftProduct *= nums[i];
    }

    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      answer[i] *= rightProduct;
      rightProduct *= nums[i];
    }

    return answer;
  };

  const output = productExceptSelf(input);

  const renderArray = (arr, highlight) => (
    <div className="flex space-x-2">
      {arr.map((num, index) => (
        <div
          key={index}
          className={`w-10 h-10 flex items-center justify-center border ${
            highlight === index ? "bg-yellow-200" : "bg-white"
          }`}
        >
          {num}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">
        Product of Array Except Self Visualization
      </h2>
      <div className="mb-4">
        <div>Input: {renderArray(input)}</div>
        <div>Output: {renderArray(output, step)}</div>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-4">
        <button
          className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
          onClick={() => setStep((prevStep) => (prevStep + 1) % input.length)}
        >
          Next Step
        </button>
      </div>
      <div>
        Step {step + 1}: Product except {input[step]} is {output[step]}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductExceptSelfVisualization;
```

This visualization helps to understand how the algorithm computes the product for each element by highlighting the current element being processed.

Recommendation:
The two-pass approach is the best solution to learn for this problem because:

1. It meets all the requirements (O(n) time, no division, O(1) extra space).
2. It's relatively simple to understand and implement.
3. It's efficient in both time and space complexity.

Follow-up: O(1) extra space complexity

The solution we provided already uses O(1) extra space (excluding the output array). We initialize the output array with 1s and then modify it in-place. No additional data structures are used that grow with the input size.
