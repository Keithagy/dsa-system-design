## Explanation: Maximal Square

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem involves finding the largest square submatrix consisting entirely of 1's in a binary matrix. The key aspects to consider are:

1. We're dealing with a 2D binary matrix, where each cell is either '0' or '1'.
2. We're looking for a square, not just any rectangle.
3. The square must consist entirely of 1's.
4. We need to return the area of the largest such square, not the square itself.

The pattern-matching principle here is dynamic programming (DP). This problem is a classic DP problem because:

1. It has an optimal substructure: the solution to a larger problem can be constructed from solutions to smaller subproblems.
2. It has overlapping subproblems: the same subproblems are solved multiple times.

The key principle that makes this question simple is: the size of the largest square ending at any position (i, j) depends on the sizes of the largest squares ending at (i-1, j), (i, j-1), and (i-1, j-1). This allows us to build our solution incrementally.

### Test cases

1. Basic case:

   ```python
   matrix = [
       ["1","0","1","0","0"],
       ["1","0","1","1","1"],
       ["1","1","1","1","1"],
       ["1","0","0","1","0"]
   ]
   # Expected output: 4
   ```

2. Edge case - single element matrix:

   ```python
   matrix = [["0"]]
   # Expected output: 0
   ```

3. Edge case - all 1's:

   ```python
   matrix = [
       ["1","1","1"],
       ["1","1","1"],
       ["1","1","1"]
   ]
   # Expected output: 9
   ```

4. Edge case - all 0's:

   ```python
   matrix = [
       ["0","0","0"],
       ["0","0","0"],
       ["0","0","0"]
   ]
   # Expected output: 0
   ```

5. Challenging case - largest square not in bottom-right corner:
   ```python
   matrix = [
       ["1","1","1","1","0"],
       ["1","1","1","1","0"],
       ["1","1","1","1","1"],
       ["1","1","1","1","1"],
       ["0","0","1","1","1"]
   ]
   # Expected output: 16
   ```

Here's the executable Python code for these test cases:

```python
def maximal_square(matrix):
    # Implementation will go here
    pass

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]],
    [["0"]],
    [["1","1","1"],["1","1","1"],["1","1","1"]],
    [["0","0","0"],["0","0","0"],["0","0","0"]],
    [["1","1","1","1","0"],["1","1","1","1","0"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["0","0","1","1","1"]]
]

for i, case in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
    result = maximal_square(case)
    print(f"Test case {i}: {result}")
```

Count: 4 solutions (1 Neetcode solution)

##### Rejected solutions

1. Depth-First Search (DFS): While DFS can find connected components, it's not efficient for finding squares and doesn't leverage the problem's structure.
2. Union-Find: This algorithm is more suitable for disjoint set problems and doesn't efficiently capture the square property.

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Dynamic Programming with 2D array (Neetcode solution)

```python
from typing import List

def maximal_square(matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    if not matrix:
        return 0

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = [[0] * (cols + 1) for _ in range(rows + 1)]
    max_side = 0

    for i in range(1, rows + 1):
        for j in range(1, cols + 1):
            if matrix[i-1][j-1] == '1':
                # The key DP transition: min of left, top, and top-left neighbors, plus 1
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                max_side = max(max_side, dp[i][j])

    return max_side * max_side
```

Runtime complexity: O(m\*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. We iterate through each cell in the matrix once.

Space complexity: O(m\*n) to store the DP table.

Intuition and invariants:

- dp[i][j] represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at position (i-1, j-1) in the original matrix.
- The DP transition leverages the fact that to form a square, we need 1's to the left, top, and top-left of the current position.
- The minimum of these three positions determines the largest square we can form at the current position.
- We use a 1-indexed DP table to simplify boundary conditions.

##### Dynamic Programming with 1D array

```python
from typing import List

def maximal_square(matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    if not matrix:
        return 0

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = [0] * (cols + 1)
    max_side = 0
    prev = 0  # Store the previous diagonal value

    for i in range(1, rows + 1):
        for j in range(1, cols + 1):
            temp = dp[j]
            if matrix[i-1][j-1] == '1':
                # Use prev as the diagonal value (top-left in 2D DP)
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-1], prev) + 1
                max_side = max(max_side, dp[j])
            else:
                dp[j] = 0
            prev = temp  # Update prev for the next iteration

    return max_side * max_side
```

Runtime complexity: O(m\*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.

Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of columns. We only use a 1D array of length n+1.

Intuition and invariants:

- This solution optimizes space by using only a 1D array instead of a 2D array.
- We maintain a `prev` variable to store the diagonal value (which was dp[i-1][j-1] in the 2D version).
- The DP transition remains the same, but we update and use values in-place in the 1D array.
- This approach demonstrates how we can often optimize DP solutions by recognizing that we only need the previous row's information.

##### Dynamic Programming with constant space

```python
from typing import List

def maximal_square(matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    if not matrix:
        return 0

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    max_side = 0
    prev = 0  # Store the previous diagonal value
    dp = [0] * (cols + 1)  # Only need one row

    for i in range(1, rows + 1):
        for j in range(1, cols + 1):
            temp = dp[j]
            if matrix[i-1][j-1] == '1':
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-1], prev) + 1
                max_side = max(max_side, dp[j])
            else:
                dp[j] = 0
            prev = temp

    return max_side * max_side
```

Runtime complexity: O(m\*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.

Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of columns. We use a single array of length n+1 and two additional variables.

Intuition and invariants:

- This solution is almost identical to the 1D DP approach, but it's worth noting separately because it achieves constant extra space relative to the input.
- We're reusing the same principles as in the 1D approach, showing that sometimes the most space-efficient solution is very similar to less efficient ones.
- This approach is particularly valuable in interviews to demonstrate understanding of space optimization in DP problems.

##### Brute Force approach

```python
from typing import List

def maximal_square(matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    if not matrix:
        return 0

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    max_side = 0

    def is_valid_square(top, left, size):
        for i in range(top, top + size):
            for j in range(left, left + size):
                if matrix[i][j] == '0':
                    return False
        return True

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                current_size = 1
                while (i + current_size < rows and
                       j + current_size < cols and
                       is_valid_square(i, j, current_size + 1)):
                    current_size += 1
                max_side = max(max_side, current_size)

    return max_side * max_side
```

Runtime complexity: O(m\*n\*min(m,n)^2), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. For each cell, we potentially check up to min(m,n)^2 cells to verify squares.

Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Intuition and invariants:

- This approach checks every possible square starting from each '1' in the matrix.
- For each starting point, we expand the square size until we either hit the matrix boundary or find a '0'.
- While inefficient, this approach is intuitive and can be a good starting point in an interview to demonstrate problem-solving skills before optimizing.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Depth-First Search (DFS):

   - Why it seems correct: DFS is often used for finding connected components in graphs, and this problem involves finding connected 1's.
   - Why it's not optimal: DFS doesn't efficiently capture the square property. It would find arbitrary shapes of connected 1's, not necessarily squares.

2. Union-Find:

   - Why it seems correct: Union-Find is good for grouping elements, which might seem useful for grouping 1's.
   - Why it's not optimal: While Union-Find could group connected 1's, it doesn't inherently maintain the square shape requirement, making it inefficient for this specific problem.

3. Sliding Window:
   - Why it seems correct: Sliding window is often used for subarray problems, and this involves finding a submatrix.
   - Why it's not optimal: The square property makes a simple sliding window approach inefficient, as we'd need to check multiple window sizes at each position.

#### Final Recommendations

The Dynamic Programming approach with a 2D array (the Neetcode solution) is the best to learn for several reasons:

1. It's the most intuitive DP solution, making it easier to understand and explain in an interview setting.
2. It clearly demonstrates the problem's optimal substructure, a key concept in DP.
3. It has a good balance of time and space efficiency (both O(m\*n)).
4. It's easier to code and less prone to errors compared to the 1D array or constant space versions.

While the 1D array and constant space solutions are more space-efficient, they're also more complex and harder to implement without errors under interview pressure. The 2D DP solution is a great starting point, and you can always mention the possibility of space optimization as a follow-up discussion.

The brute force approach, while not efficient, is worth understanding as it can be a good starting point in an interview to demonstrate your problem-solving process before moving to more optimized solutions.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the DP approach, we can use a simple HTML table to show how the DP table is filled:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      table {
        border-collapse: collapse;
      }
      td {
        width: 30px;
        height: 30px;
        text-align: center;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
      .highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Original Matrix</h2>
    <table id="original"></table>
    <h2>DP Table</h2>
    <table id="dp"></table>
    <button onclick="nextStep()">Next Step</button>
    <p id="explanation"></p>

    <script>
      const matrix = [
        ["1", "0", "1", "0", "0"],
        ["1", "0", "1", "1", "1"],
        ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
        ["1", "0", "0", "1", "0"],
      ];
      const dp = Array(matrix.length + 1)
        .fill()
        .map(() => Array(matrix[0].length + 1).fill(0));
      let currentRow = 1;
      let currentCol = 1;

      function createTable(tableId, data) {
        const table = document.getElementById(tableId);
        for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
          const row = table.insertRow();
          for (let j = 0; j < data[i].length; j++) {
            const cell = row.insertCell();
            cell.textContent = data[i][j];
          }
        }
      }

      createTable("original", matrix);
      createTable("dp", dp);

      function nextStep() {
        if (currentRow <= matrix.length) {
          const dpTable = document.getElementById("dp");
          const cell = dpTable.rows[currentRow].cells[currentCol];
          cell.classList.add("highlight");

          if (matrix[currentRow - 1][currentCol - 1] === "1") {
            const left = parseInt(
              dpTable.rows[currentRow].cells[currentCol - 1].textContent,
            );
            const top = parseInt(
              dpTable.rows[currentRow - 1].cells[currentCol].textContent,
            );
            const topLeft = parseInt(
              dpTable.rows[currentRow - 1].cells[currentCol - 1].textContent,
            );
            dp[currentRow][currentCol] = Math.min(left, top, topLeft) + 1;
            cell.textContent = dp[currentRow][currentCol];
            document.getElementById("explanation").textContent =
              `At (${currentRow},${currentCol}): min(${left},${top},${topLeft}) + 1 = ${dp[currentRow][currentCol]}`;
          } else {
            cell.textContent = "0";
            document.getElementById("explanation").textContent =
              `At (${currentRow},${currentCol}): Original matrix has 0, so DP value is 0`;
          }

          currentCol++;
          if (currentCol > matrix[0].length) {
            currentRow++;
            currentCol = 1;
          }
        } else {
          document.getElementById("explanation").textContent =
            "DP table is complete!";
        }
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This visualization allows you to step through the DP process, showing how each cell in the DP table is filled based on its neighbors. It helps illustrate the core concept of the DP solution: that each cell's value depends on the values of its left, top, and top-left neighbors.
