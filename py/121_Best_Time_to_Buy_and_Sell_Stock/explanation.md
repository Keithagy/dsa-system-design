Certainly! Let's explore different solutions to this problem, known as the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem. We'll start with a brute force approach and then move on to more optimized solutions.

1. Brute Force Approach

Let's start with the simplest solution, which is to check every possible pair of buy and sell days.

```python
from typing import List

def max_profit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    max_profit = 0
    n = len(prices)

    # Iterate through all possible buy days
    for i in range(n):
        # For each buy day, check all possible sell days after it
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Calculate profit for this buy-sell pair
            profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
            # Update max_profit if this profit is greater
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)

    return max_profit

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [7,1,5,3,6,4],
    [7,6,4,3,1],
    [2,4,1],
    [3,2,6,5,0,3],
]

for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {max_profit(case)}")
    print()

```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the prices array. We have two nested loops, each potentially iterating through all elements.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

This solution, while correct, is not efficient for large inputs due to its quadratic time complexity.

2. One-Pass Solution

A more efficient approach is to iterate through the array once, keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved.

```python
from typing import List

def max_profit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    if not prices:
        return 0

    min_price = float('inf')  # Initialize min_price to positive infinity
    max_profit = 0

    for price in prices:
        # Update min_price if we find a lower price
        min_price = min(min_price, price)

        # Calculate potential profit if we sell at current price
        current_profit = price - min_price

        # Update max_profit if current_profit is greater
        max_profit = max(max_profit, current_profit)

    return max_profit

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [7,1,5,3,6,4],
    [7,6,4,3,1],
    [2,4,1],
    [3,2,6,5,0,3],
]

for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {max_profit(case)}")
    print()

```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the prices array. We only pass through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

This solution is much more efficient than the brute force approach, especially for large inputs.

Recommendation:
I would recommend learning and using the One-Pass Solution. It's significantly more efficient than the brute force approach, especially for large inputs, and it's not much more complex to understand or implement. This solution demonstrates a common pattern in algorithm design where we can solve a problem in a single pass through the data by maintaining some state (in this case, the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit).

Visualization:
To help understand how the One-Pass Solution works, let's create a simple visualization using a React component.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  LineChart,
  Line,
  XAxis,
  YAxis,
  Tooltip,
  CartesianGrid,
  ResponsiveContainer,
} from "recharts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";

const StockProfitVisualization = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
  const prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4];
  const [minPrice, setMinPrice] = useState(prices[0]);
  const [maxProfit, setMaxProfit] = useState(0);

  const nextStep = () => {
    if (step < prices.length) {
      const price = prices[step];
      setMinPrice(Math.min(minPrice, price));
      setMaxProfit(Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice));
      setStep(step + 1);
    }
  };

  const reset = () => {
    setStep(0);
    setMinPrice(prices[0]);
    setMaxProfit(0);
  };

  const data = prices.map((price, index) => ({
    day: index + 1,
    price: price,
    visited: index < step,
  }));

  return (
    <Card className="w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto">
      <CardHeader>Stock Profit Visualization</CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
          <LineChart data={data}>
            <XAxis dataKey="day" />
            <YAxis />
            <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
            <Tooltip />
            <Line
              type="monotone"
              dataKey="price"
              stroke="#8884d8"
              dot={{ fill: "#8884d8" }}
            />
          </LineChart>
        </ResponsiveContainer>
        <div className="mt-4">
          <p>Current Step: {step}</p>
          <p>Min Price: {minPrice}</p>
          <p>Max Profit: {maxProfit}</p>
          <Button
            onClick={nextStep}
            disabled={step >= prices.length}
            className="mr-2"
          >
            Next Step
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={reset}>Reset</Button>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default StockProfitVisualization;
```

This visualization allows you to step through the algorithm, seeing how the minimum price and maximum profit are updated at each step. The blue line represents the stock prices, and the filled circles indicate which prices have been processed so far.

To use this visualization:

1. Click "Next Step" to process each price in the array.
2. Observe how the minimum price and maximum profit change with each step.
3. Use the "Reset" button to start over.

This interactive component helps illustrate how the One-Pass Solution efficiently finds the maximum profit in a single pass through the data.
