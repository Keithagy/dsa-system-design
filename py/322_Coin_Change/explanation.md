Certainly! Let's explore different solutions to the Coin Change problem, analyze their complexities, and provide visualizations where helpful. We'll start with a basic recursive solution and then move on to more optimized approaches.

1. Recursive Solution (Not Optimal):

Let's start with a simple recursive solution to understand the problem better:

```python
from typing import List

def coin_change(coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
    def recurse(remaining: int) -> int:
        # Base case: if the remaining amount is 0, we've found a valid combination
        if remaining == 0:
            return 0
        # If the remaining amount is negative, this combination is not valid
        if remaining < 0:
            return float('inf')

        # Try using each coin and recursively solve for the remaining amount
        min_coins = float('inf')
        for coin in coins:
            result = recurse(remaining - coin)
            if result != float('inf'):
                min_coins = min(min_coins, result + 1)

        return min_coins

    result = recurse(amount)
    return result if result != float('inf') else -1

# Test cases
print(coin_change([1, 2, 5], 11))  # Expected output: 3
print(coin_change([2], 3))         # Expected output: -1
print(coin_change([1], 0))         # Expected output: 0

```

This recursive solution has the following characteristics:

- Time Complexity: O(amount^n), where n is the number of coin denominations. This is because for each amount, we have n choices, and the depth of the recursion tree can go up to the amount.
- Space Complexity: O(amount) due to the recursion stack.

This solution is not optimal due to its exponential time complexity. It repeatedly solves the same subproblems, leading to inefficiency.

2. Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up) Solution:

Now, let's implement a more efficient solution using dynamic programming:

```python
from typing import List

def coin_change(coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
    # Initialize dp array with amount + 1 (impossible value) for all amounts
    dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make amount 0

    # Iterate through all amounts from 1 to target amount
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        # For each coin, check if it can contribute to the current amount
        for coin in coins:
            if coin <= i:
                # Update dp[i] if using this coin results in fewer total coins
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    # Return the result, or -1 if it's still the initial impossible value
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != amount + 1 else -1

# Test cases
print(coin_change([1, 2, 5], 11))  # Expected output: 3
print(coin_change([2], 3))         # Expected output: -1
print(coin_change([1], 0))         # Expected output: 0

```

This dynamic programming solution has the following characteristics:

- Time Complexity: O(amount \* n), where n is the number of coin denominations. We iterate through each amount up to the target and consider each coin for that amount.
- Space Complexity: O(amount) for the dp array.

This solution is much more efficient than the recursive approach, especially for larger amounts.

To visualize how this algorithm works, let's create a simple React component that demonstrates the DP table filling process:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";

const CoinChangeVisualization = () => {
  const [coins, setCoins] = useState([1, 2, 5]);
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState(11);
  const [dp, setDp] = useState([]);
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const calculateDP = () => {
      const newDp = Array(amount + 1).fill(amount + 1);
      newDp[0] = 0;
      setDp(newDp);
      setStep(0);
    };
    calculateDP();
  }, [coins, amount]);

  const nextStep = () => {
    if (step <= amount) {
      const newDp = [...dp];
      for (const coin of coins) {
        if (coin <= step) {
          newDp[step] = Math.min(newDp[step], newDp[step - coin] + 1);
        }
      }
      setDp(newDp);
      setStep(step + 1);
    }
  };

  return (
    <Card className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto">
      <CardHeader>Coin Change DP Visualization</CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="mb-4">
          <p>Coins: {coins.join(", ")}</p>
          <p>Target Amount: {amount}</p>
          <p>Current Step: {step}</p>
        </div>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-12 gap-2">
          {dp.map((value, index) => (
            <div
              key={index}
              className={`p-2 border ${
                index === step - 1
                  ? "bg-blue-200"
                  : index < step
                    ? "bg-green-100"
                    : ""
              }`}
            >
              {value === amount + 1 ? "∞" : value}
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
        <button
          onClick={nextStep}
          disabled={step > amount}
          className="mt-4 px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded disabled:bg-gray-300"
        >
          Next Step
        </button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default CoinChangeVisualization;
```

This visualization helps to understand how the DP table is filled step by step. Each cell represents the minimum number of coins needed for that amount, with '∞' representing an impossible combination.

Recommendation:
The dynamic programming solution is the best one to learn for this problem. It offers a good balance of efficiency and simplicity. Here's why:

1. Time Efficiency: It solves the problem in O(amount \* n) time, which is much better than the exponential time of the recursive solution.
2. Space Efficiency: It uses O(amount) space, which is reasonable and often acceptable in interview settings.
3. Understandability: The concept of building up solutions for smaller amounts to solve for larger amounts is intuitive and widely applicable in other DP problems.
4. Implementability: It's relatively straightforward to implement, with a single loop over the amount and an inner loop over the coins.

In an interview setting, starting with the recursive solution to explain your thought process and then optimizing it to the DP solution would demonstrate both problem-solving skills and optimization abilities.

For further practice, you could consider:

1. Implementing a top-down DP solution with memoization.
2. Optimizing the space complexity to O(max(coins)) using a rolling array technique.
3. Solving related problems like the "Coin Change 2" problem, which asks for the number of ways to make the amount.

## Recursive solution in detail

I apologize for not explaining the recursive solution more clearly. Let's break it down step by step to make it easier to understand.

Let's start by revisiting the recursive solution, and then I'll explain how it works in detail:

```python
from typing import List

def coin_change(coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
    def recurse(remaining: int) -> int:
        if remaining == 0:
            return 0
        if remaining < 0:
            return float('inf')

        min_coins = float('inf')
        for coin in coins:
            result = recurse(remaining - coin)
            if result != float('inf'):
                min_coins = min(min_coins, result + 1)

        return min_coins

    result = recurse(amount)
    return result if result != float('inf') else -1
```

Now, let's break down how this recursive solution works:

1. The main function `coin_change` takes two parameters:

   - `coins`: a list of available coin denominations
   - `amount`: the target amount we want to make

2. Inside `coin_change`, we define a helper function `recurse` that does the actual recursive calculation.

3. The `recurse` function takes one parameter:

   - `remaining`: the remaining amount we need to make with coins

4. Base cases in `recurse`:

   - If `remaining == 0`, we've successfully used coins to reach the target amount, so we return 0 (no more coins needed).
   - If `remaining < 0`, we've overshot the target amount, so we return infinity (float('inf')) to indicate an invalid combination.

5. The recursive case:

   - We initialize `min_coins` to infinity. This will keep track of the minimum number of coins needed.
   - We iterate through each coin in our `coins` list.
   - For each coin, we recursively call `recurse(remaining - coin)`. This is like saying, "If I use this coin, how many more coins would I need to make the rest of the amount?"
   - If the result of the recursive call is not infinity (meaning it found a valid combination), we update `min_coins` if this new combination uses fewer coins.

6. After trying all coins, we return `min_coins`. This will be infinity if no valid combination was found, or the minimum number of coins needed otherwise.

7. Finally, in the main `coin_change` function, we call `recurse(amount)` and return the result, or -1 if no valid combination was found.

Let's walk through an example to see how this works:

Suppose we have `coins = [1, 2, 5]` and `amount = 11`.

1. We start with `recurse(11)`.
2. It tries using each coin:
   - If it uses a 1-coin: `recurse(10)`
   - If it uses a 2-coin: `recurse(9)`
   - If it uses a 5-coin: `recurse(6)`
3. Each of these calls will in turn make similar recursive calls.
4. This process continues until we hit our base cases (remaining = 0 or remaining < 0).
5. As the recursive calls return, we build up the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.

The recursion builds a tree of possibilities, exploring all combinations of coins. It then bubbles up the minimum number of coins needed from the bottom of the tree to the top.

This solution, while intuitive, is not efficient for large amounts because it recalculates the same subproblems many times. That's why we typically optimize it using dynamic programming, as shown in the DP solution.

Would you like me to provide a visual representation of how this recursive process works for a small example? That might help clarify the concept further.
