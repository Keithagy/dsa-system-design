## Explanation: Decode String

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem involves decoding a string that has been encoded using a specific rule: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that may itself contain nested encoded substrings. The key principle that makes this question simple is recognizing that this is a problem of nested structure, which naturally lends itself to a stack-based or recursive solution.

The input data has several important characteristics:

1. The input is guaranteed to be valid, which eliminates the need for extensive error checking.
2. The string contains only lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets.
3. Digits are only used for repeat numbers (k), not as part of the string content.
4. The length of the output is guaranteed not to exceed 10^5^.
5. The input string length is relatively small (1 <= s.length <= 30).

These characteristics suggest that:

- We don't need to worry about invalid inputs or extensive error handling.
- We can easily distinguish between numbers (for repetition) and letters (for the string content).
- The solution doesn't need to be optimized for extremely large inputs.
- We can afford to use a solution that might be less efficient in terms of space complexity, as long as it handles the nested structure correctly.

The nested structure of the encoded string maps well to:

1. A stack-based iterative approach
2. A recursive approach

Both of these approaches are excellent for handling nested structures, as they naturally mirror the way the encoding is constructed.

### Test cases

Here are some test cases that cover various scenarios:

1. Basic case: `"3[a]2[bc]"` -> `"aaabcbc"`
2. Nested brackets: `"3[a2[c]]"` -> `"accaccacc"`
3. Multiple encoded substrings: `"2[abc]3[cd]ef"` -> `"abcabccdcdcdef"`
4. Single character repetition: `"10[a]"` -> `"aaaaaaaaaa"`
5. No brackets: `"abcd"` -> `"abcd"`
6. Empty brackets: `"3[]"` -> `""`
7. Nested brackets with different numbers: `"2[3[a]b]"` -> `"aaabaaab"`

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def test_decode_string(decode_function):
    test_cases = [
        ("3[a]2[bc]", "aaabcbc"),
        ("3[a2[c]]", "accaccacc"),
        ("2[abc]3[cd]ef", "abcabccdcdcdef"),
        ("10[a]", "aaaaaaaaaa"),
        ("abcd", "abcd"),
        ("3[]", ""),
        ("2[3[a]b]", "aaabaaab")
    ]

    for i, (input_string, expected_output) in enumerate(test_cases):
        result = decode_function(input_string)
        assert result == expected_output, f"Test case {i+1} failed. Expected {expected_output}, but got {result}"

    print("All test cases passed!")

# Usage:
# test_decode_string(your_decode_string_function)
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Recursive approach (Neetcode solution)

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        def decode(index):
            result = []
            k = 0
            while index < len(s):
                if s[index].isdigit():
                    # Build the number k
                    k = k * 10 + int(s[index])
                elif s[index] == '[':
                    # Recursive call to handle nested brackets
                    nested_str, next_index = decode(index + 1)
                    # Repeat the nested string k times
                    result.append(k * nested_str)
                    k = 0  # Reset k for the next potential number
                    index = next_index
                elif s[index] == ']':
                    # End of current nested structure
                    return ''.join(result), index
                else:
                    # Regular character, add to result
                    result.append(s[index])
                index += 1
            return ''.join(result), index

        return decode(0)[0]
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the decoded string. This is because each character in the final decoded string is processed exactly once.

Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, due to the recursive call stack. The maximum depth of recursion is equal to the maximum nesting level of brackets in the input string.

Intuitions and invariants:

- The recursive structure naturally handles nested encoded strings.
- Each recursive call corresponds to the content inside a pair of brackets.
- The function returns both the decoded string and the index where it stopped, allowing the parent call to continue from the correct position.
- The number k is built digit by digit to handle multi-digit numbers.
- The result is built as a list of strings for efficiency, then joined at the end.

##### Stack-based iterative approach (Neetcode solution)

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        current_string = ""
        current_number = 0

        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # Build the number
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # Push the current state onto the stack and reset
                stack.append((current_string, current_number))
                current_string = ""
                current_number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # Pop the previous state and apply the repetition
                prev_string, num = stack.pop()
                current_string = prev_string + num * current_string
            else:
                # Regular character, add to current string
                current_string += char

        return current_string
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the decoded string. Each character in the input is processed once, and each character in the output is generated once.

Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the maximum nesting depth. In the worst case, this could be O(n) if the string is deeply nested.

Intuitions and invariants:

- The stack stores the state (current string and number) before entering a new bracket pair.
- Current number and string are built incrementally as we traverse the input.
- When we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the previous state and apply the repetition.
- The stack naturally handles nested structures by storing outer contexts while processing inner ones.

##### Two-stack approach

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        num_stack = []
        str_stack = ['']
        current_num = 0

        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # Build the number
                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # Push current number and start a new string
                num_stack.append(current_num)
                str_stack.append('')
                current_num = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # Pop and apply repetition
                repeat = num_stack.pop()
                current_str = str_stack.pop()
                str_stack[-1] += repeat * current_str
            else:
                # Regular character, add to current string
                str_stack[-1] += char

        return str_stack[0]
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the decoded string. Each character in the input is processed once, and each character in the output is generated once.

Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the maximum nesting depth. In the worst case, this could be O(n) if the string is deeply nested.

Intuitions and invariants:

- Two stacks are used: one for numbers and one for strings.
- The string stack always has at least one element (the outermost string).
- Each opening bracket starts a new string on the string stack.
- Each closing bracket pops a number and a string, applies the repetition, and appends to the previous string.
- The final result is always in the first (and possibly only) element of the string stack.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Regular expression-based solution: While regex can handle simple repetitions, it struggles with nested structures. It's not suitable for this problem due to the arbitrary nesting depth allowed in the input.

2. Brute force string manipulation: This approach would involve expanding the string from left to right, replacing each `k[...]` with its expanded form. While this might work for simple cases, it becomes extremely inefficient for nested structures and large repetition numbers.

3. Dynamic Programming: This problem doesn't have overlapping subproblems or optimal substructure in a way that would make DP beneficial. The nested structure is better handled by stack-based or recursive approaches.

#### Final Recommendations

The recursive approach (Neetcode solution) is recommended as the best solution to learn for several reasons:

1. It naturally mirrors the structure of the problem, making it intuitive to understand and explain.
2. It handles nested structures elegantly without need for explicit stack management.
3. It's concise and readable, making it easier to implement correctly in a high-pressure interview situation.
4. The time and space complexity are optimal for this problem.

The stack-based iterative approach is a close second and worth learning as well, especially for those who prefer iterative solutions or are concerned about potential stack overflow issues with very deeply nested inputs.

### Visualization(s)

For this problem, a visualization of the stack states during processing would be helpful. Here's a simple ASCII representation for the input "2[a3[b]]":

```
Input: 2[a3[b]]

Step 1: 2[
Stack: [(2, "")]

Step 2: 2[a
Stack: [(2, "")]
Current string: "a"

Step 3: 2[a3[
Stack: [(2, "a"), (3, "")]

Step 4: 2[a3[b]]
Stack: [(2, "a")]
Current string: "bbb"

Final step:
Result: "abbbabbb"
```

This visualization helps to understand how the stack keeps track of the nested structure and how the repetitions are applied.
