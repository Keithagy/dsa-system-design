## Explanation: Daily Temperatures

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is a classic example of a monotonic stack application. The key characteristics of the problem that guide us towards this solution are:

1. We're looking for the next greater element for each item in the array.
2. We need to keep track of the number of days (indices) between the current temperature and the next warmer temperature.
3. The order of the temperatures matters, as we're dealing with daily sequences.

The key principle that makes this question simple is the realization that we can use a stack to keep track of temperatures (and their indices) in a decreasing order. This allows us to efficiently find the next warmer temperature for each day.

The input data has some notable characteristics:

- The temperatures are integers, which allows for easy comparisons.
- The range of temperatures is limited (30 to 100), which doesn't significantly impact our approach but could be leveraged for optimization in certain solutions.
- The length of the input array can be quite large (up to 10^5), so we need to be mindful of time complexity.

Pattern-matching wise, this problem falls into the category of:

1. Monotonic stack problems
2. Next Greater Element problems
3. Array traversal with lookback

Understanding these patterns helps in quickly identifying the optimal approach for solving this and similar problems.

### Test cases

Here are some relevant test cases to consider:

1. Standard case:

   ```python
   temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
   # Expected output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
   ```

2. Monotonically increasing temperatures:

   ```python
   temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
   # Expected output: [1,1,1,0]
   ```

3. Monotonically decreasing temperatures:

   ```python
   temperatures = [60,50,40,30]
   # Expected output: [0,0,0,0]
   ```

4. Single temperature:

   ```python
   temperatures = [30]
   # Expected output: [0]
   ```

5. Repeated temperatures:

   ```python
   temperatures = [30,30,30,30]
   # Expected output: [0,0,0,0]
   ```

6. Alternating temperatures:

   ```python
   temperatures = [30,60,30,60]
   # Expected output: [1,0,1,0]
   ```

7. Edge case with maximum length and temperature range:

   ```python
   temperatures = [30] * 100000 + [31]
   # Expected output: [100000] + [0] * 100000
   ```

Here's the executable Python code for these test cases:

```python
def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Implementation will go here
    pass

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73],
    [30,40,50,60],
    [60,50,40,30],
    [30],
    [30,30,30,30],
    [30,60,30,60],
    [30] * 100000 + [31]
]

for i, case in enumerate(test_cases):
    print(f"Test case {i + 1}:")
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {dailyTemperatures(case)}")
    print()
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Monotonic Stack

```python
from typing import List

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    stack = []  # Stack to store indices of temperatures

    for i in range(n):
        # While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is warmer
        while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            prev_index = stack.pop()
            answer[prev_index] = i - prev_index
        stack.append(i)

    return answer
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the temperatures array.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where temperatures are in descending order.

Explanation:

- We iterate through the array once, and each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. This leads to a time complexity of O(n).
- In the worst case (descending temperatures), we might end up storing all indices in the stack before we start popping, leading to a space complexity of O(n).

Key intuitions and invariants:

- The stack maintains indices of temperatures in decreasing order.
- When we find a warmer temperature, we can calculate the wait time for all cooler temperatures in the stack.
- The stack always contains indices of temperatures that haven't found their next warmer day yet.

##### Optimized Monotonic Stack with array

```python
from typing import List

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    stack = [0] * n  # Pre-allocated array to use as a stack
    top = -1  # Index of the top of the stack

    for i in range(n):
        while top >= 0 and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[top]]:
            prev_index = stack[top]
            answer[prev_index] = i - prev_index
            top -= 1
        top += 1
        stack[top] = i

    return answer
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the temperatures array.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the pre-allocated array used as a stack.

Explanation:

- This solution is essentially the same as the previous one, but it uses a pre-allocated array as a stack instead of Python's built-in list.
- The time complexity remains O(n) as we still process each element once.
- The space complexity is O(n) for the pre-allocated array, but it might be slightly more efficient in practice due to better memory locality.

Key intuitions and invariants:

- Same as the previous solution, but with manual stack management using an array.
- This approach can be more efficient in languages with manual memory management or when dealing with very large inputs.

##### Two Pointers (Reverse Iteration)

```python
from typing import List

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    hottest = 0

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        current_temp = temperatures[i]
        if current_temp >= hottest:
            hottest = current_temp
            continue

        days = 1
        while temperatures[i + days] <= current_temp:
            days += answer[i + days]
        answer[i] = days

    return answer
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the temperatures array.
Space Complexity: O(1) extra space (not counting the output array).

Explanation:

- We iterate through the array in reverse, which allows us to use information from future days.
- The `hottest` variable keeps track of the highest temperature seen so far.
- For each temperature less than the hottest, we use the `answer` array to jump to the next warmer temperature efficiently.
- Although there's a nested while loop, each element is processed at most twice (once in the outer loop, and at most once in all inner loops combined), leading to O(n) time complexity.

Key intuitions and invariants:

- Temperatures greater than or equal to the hottest seen don't need processing (they'll have 0 days to wait).
- For other temperatures, we can use previously computed answers to "jump" to potential warmer days, reducing unnecessary comparisons.

##### Brute Force

```python
from typing import List

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if temperatures[j] > temperatures[i]:
                answer[i] = j - i
                break

    return answer
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the temperatures array.
Space Complexity: O(1) extra space (not counting the output array).

Explanation:

- For each temperature, we iterate through the rest of the array to find the next warmer day.
- In the worst case (descending temperatures), for each element, we might need to check all subsequent elements, leading to O(n^2) time complexity.
- We only use a constant amount of extra space (the `answer` array is not counted as extra space as it's part of the problem requirements).

Key intuitions and invariants:

- This approach directly implements the problem statement without any optimizations.
- It's intuitive and easy to understand but becomes inefficient for large inputs.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Sorting-based approach: While sorting the temperatures might seem like a way to easily find the next greater temperature, it would lose the original order of the temperatures, which is crucial for determining the number of days to wait.

2. Binary Search Tree: A BST could help find the next greater element efficiently, but it wouldn't keep track of the number of days between temperatures without additional complexity. The overhead of constructing and maintaining the BST would likely outweigh any benefits for this specific problem.

3. Hash Map approach: Using a hash map to store temperatures and their indices might seem like a way to quickly look up temperatures, but it doesn't provide an efficient way to find the next greater temperature or calculate the number of days between temperatures.

#### Final Recommendations

The Monotonic Stack solution (Neetcode solution) is the best to learn for this problem. It offers the optimal balance of time and space complexity while being relatively straightforward to understand and implement. Here's why:

1. Time Efficiency: It solves the problem in O(n) time, which is optimal for this problem.
2. Space Efficiency: While it uses O(n) space in the worst case, this is often better in practice than the O(n) space always used by the array-based optimized version.
3. Versatility: The monotonic stack pattern is applicable to many similar problems, making it a valuable technique to master.
4. Intuitive: Once understood, the logic behind the monotonic stack is quite intuitive and aligns well with the problem's requirements.

The Two Pointers (Reverse Iteration) solution is also worth understanding as it provides a different perspective on the problem and achieves O(1) extra space complexity. However, it might be slightly less intuitive at first glance.

The Brute Force solution, while straightforward, is not recommended for interviews due to its poor time complexity. However, it's worth understanding as a starting point to appreciate the optimizations in other solutions.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the Monotonic Stack solution, we can use a simple ASCII art representation:

```
Temperatures: [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
Step-by-step process:

1. [73]
2. [73, 74]
3. [73, 74, 75]
4. [73, 74, 75, 71]
5. [73, 74, 75, 71, 69]
6. [73, 74, 75, 72]
7. [76]
8. [76, 73]

Final answer: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

Each line represents the state of the stack after processing the corresponding temperature. When a temperature is processed that's warmer than the top of the stack, we pop elements and calculate their wait times.

For a more interactive visualization, we could create a simple React component that shows the stack's state and the answer array updating step-by-step as we process each temperature. However, as I cannot generate or display actual images or interactive components, I'll provide a conceptual description of what such a visualization might look like:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const DailyTemperaturesVisualizer = () => {
  const [temperatures, setTemperatures] = useState([
    73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73,
  ]);
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);
  const [stack, setStack] = useState([]);
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState(new Array(temperatures.length).fill(0));

  // ... implementation details ...

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Temperatures: {temperatures.join(", ")}</div>
      <div>Current Index: {currentIndex}</div>
      <div>Stack: {stack.join(", ")}</div>
      <div>Answer: {answer.join(", ")}</div>
      <button onClick={stepForward}>Step Forward</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DailyTemperaturesVisualizer;
```

This component would allow users to step through the algorithm, seeing how the stack and answer array change with each temperature processed. It would provide a clear, interactive demonstration of how the monotonic stack solution works.
