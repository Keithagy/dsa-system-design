## Explanation: Daily Temperatures

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is a classic example of a monotonic stack application. The key characteristics of the problem that lead us to this solution are:

1. We're looking for the next greater element for each item in the array.
2. We need to keep track of the number of days (indices) between the current temperature and the next warmer temperature.
3. The order of the elements matters, as we're dealing with daily sequences.

The input data has some noteworthy characteristics:

- The temperatures are integers, which allows for easy comparisons.
- The range of temperatures is limited (30 to 100), which could potentially be exploited for optimization in certain solutions.
- The array length can be quite large (up to 10^5), so we need to be mindful of time complexity.

The key principle that makes this question simple is the realization that we can process the array from right to left, maintaining a stack of temperatures. This stack will always be monotonically decreasing, allowing us to efficiently find the next warmer temperature for each day.

### Test cases

Here are some relevant test cases, including edge cases and challenging inputs:

1. Standard case: `[73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]` → `[1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]`
2. All increasing: `[30,40,50,60]` → `[1,1,1,0]`
3. All decreasing: `[60,50,40,30]` → `[0,0,0,0]`
4. Single element: `[30]` → `[0]`
5. Two elements, increasing: `[30,40]` → `[1,0]`
6. Two elements, decreasing: `[40,30]` → `[0,0]`
7. Large temperature difference: `[30,60,90]` → `[1,1,0]`
8. Repeated temperatures: `[70,70,70,70]` → `[0,0,0,0]`
9. Mixed repeated and increasing: `[70,70,75,70,80]` → `[2,1,1,1,0]`
10. Maximum length array with random temperatures (not shown due to size)

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Implementation goes here
    pass

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73],
    [30,40,50,60],
    [60,50,40,30],
    [30],
    [30,40],
    [40,30],
    [30,60,90],
    [70,70,70,70],
    [70,70,75,70,80],
]

for i, case in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
    result = dailyTemperatures(case)
    print(f"Test case {i}: {case}")
    print(f"Result: {result}\n")

# For the maximum length array, you would typically use a random number generator
# import random
# max_length_case = [random.randint(30, 100) for _ in range(10**5)]
# result = dailyTemperatures(max_length_case)
# print(f"Max length case result length: {len(result)}")
```

##### Monotonic Stack

```python
from typing import List

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    stack = []

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        # Remove days from stack that are cooler than current day
        while stack and temperatures[i] >= temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            stack.pop()

        # If stack is not empty, top of stack is next warmer day
        if stack:
            answer[i] = stack[-1] - i

        # Add current day to stack
        stack.append(i)

    return answer
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the temperatures array. Each element is pushed and popped at most once from the stack.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where temperatures are in descending order and all elements end up in the stack.

Explanation of Big O:

- Time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once, and each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. Even though we have a while loop inside the for loop, the total number of iterations of the while loop across all iterations of the for loop is at most n.
- Space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case (temperatures in descending order), we might need to store all elements in the stack.

Intuitions and invariants:

- The stack maintains indices of days with temperatures in decreasing order.
- By processing the array from right to left, we ensure that the stack always contains future days relative to the current day.
- The difference between the current index and the top of the stack (if exists) gives us the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature.

##### Two Pointers (next array)

```python
from typing import List

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n
    next_warmer = [float('inf')] * 101  # Next warmer day for each temperature

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        # Find the closest warmer day
        warmer_index = min(next_warmer[t] for t in range(temperatures[i] + 1, 101))

        if warmer_index < float('inf'):
            answer[i] = warmer_index - i

        # Update the next warmer day for the current temperature
        next_warmer[temperatures[i]] = i

    return answer
```

Time Complexity: O(n \* m), where n is the length of the temperatures array and m is the range of temperatures (71 in this case, as temperatures are between 30 and 100).
Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the range of temperatures.

Explanation of Big O:

- Time complexity is O(n \* m) because for each of the n elements, we potentially check all m possible higher temperatures in the worst case.
- Space complexity is O(m) for the `next_warmer` array, which has a fixed size based on the temperature range.

Intuitions and invariants:

- We maintain an array `next_warmer` where `next_warmer[t]` represents the index of the next day with temperature t.
- By processing the array from right to left, we ensure that `next_warmer` always contains information about future days relative to the current day.
- The minimum index in `next_warmer` for temperatures higher than the current temperature gives us the next warmer day.

##### Brute Force with optimization

```python
from typing import List

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(temperatures)
    answer = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if temperatures[j] > temperatures[i]:
                answer[i] = j - i
                break
            # Optimization: if we've reached a day that didn't find a warmer temp,
            # we know all days between won't find one either
            if answer[j] == 0:
                break

    return answer
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the temperatures array.
Space Complexity: O(1), excluding the output array.

Explanation of Big O:

- Time complexity is O(n^2) because in the worst case (temperatures in descending order), for each element we might need to check all subsequent elements.
- Space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space, not counting the output array.

Intuitions and invariants:

- We check each subsequent day for a warmer temperature.
- The optimization breaks the inner loop if we reach a day that didn't find a warmer temperature, as we know all days between won't find one either.
- This solution, while not optimal, demonstrates a straightforward approach to the problem.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Sorting-based approach: Sorting the temperatures would lose the original order, which is crucial for determining the number of days to wait. This approach is incorrect for this problem.

2. Binary Search approach: While binary search can be efficient for finding elements, it doesn't suit this problem well because we need to find the next greater element in the original order, not just any greater element. The time complexity would likely be O(n log n) or worse, making it less efficient than the monotonic stack solution.

3. Brute Force without optimization: While correct, this approach with O(n^2) time complexity without any optimization is not worth learning for interview settings due to its inefficiency for large inputs.

#### Final Recommendations

The Monotonic Stack solution is the best to learn for this problem. It offers the optimal time complexity of O(n) and demonstrates a powerful technique applicable to many similar problems involving finding the next greater element. It's elegant, efficient, and showcases a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms.

The Two Pointers (next array) solution is also worth understanding as it provides an alternative perspective on the problem and can be more intuitive for some. However, its time complexity is slightly worse than the Monotonic Stack solution.

The optimized Brute Force solution, while not optimal, is worth knowing as it demonstrates how to improve upon a naive approach and can be a good starting point in an interview before optimizing further.
