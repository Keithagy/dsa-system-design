## Explanation: Encode and Decode Strings

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is fundamentally about designing a serialization and deserialization scheme for a list of strings. The key challenges are:

1. Handling empty strings within the list
2. Dealing with strings that may contain any valid ASCII character (0-255)
3. Ensuring that the encoding is reversible without loss of information

The critical insight here is that we need a way to demarcate the boundaries between strings in our encoded format. This is similar to problems involving parsing or tokenization, where we need to choose a delimiter or escape mechanism.

The constraints of the problem (strings containing any possible ASCII character) rule out simple delimiter-based approaches, as any chosen delimiter could potentially appear in the input strings.

This problem tests understanding of:

- String manipulation
- Encoding/decoding schemes
- Handling edge cases (empty strings, special characters)
- Designing reversible transformations

The key principle that makes this question simple is the realization that we can use a length-prefixing scheme. By prefixing each string with its length, we create an unambiguous way to separate strings, regardless of their content.

### Test cases

1. Basic case: `["Hello", "World"]`
2. Empty string in list: `["", "Hello", ""]`
3. Strings with numbers: `["123", "456"]`
4. Strings with special characters: `["a#b", "c#d"]`
5. Single string: `["SingleString"]`
6. Empty list: `[]`
7. Long strings: `["A" * 200, "B" * 200]`
8. Strings with non-printable ASCII characters: `["\x00\x01", "\x02\x03"]`

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
test_cases = [
    ["Hello", "World"],
    ["", "Hello", ""],
    ["123", "456"],
    ["a#b", "c#d"],
    ["SingleString"],
    [],
    ["A" * 200, "B" * 200],
    ["\x00\x01", "\x02\x03"]
]

def run_tests(encode, decode):
    for i, case in enumerate(test_cases):
        encoded = encode(case)
        decoded = decode(encoded)
        print(f"Test case {i+1}: {'Passed' if decoded == case else 'Failed'}")
        if decoded != case:
            print(f"  Input: {case}")
            print(f"  Decoded: {decoded}")
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Length prefixing with delimiter

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string."""
        # Use '#' as a delimiter between length and string content
        return ''.join(f"{len(s)}#{s}" for s in strs)

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings."""
        result, i = [], 0
        while i < len(s):
            # Find the next '#' delimiter
            j = s.index('#', i)
            # Extract the length of the next string
            length = int(s[i:j])
            # Extract the string content and add to result
            result.append(s[j+1 : j+1+length])
            # Move the index to the start of the next length prefix
            i = j + 1 + length
        return result
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total length of all strings.

- Encode: We iterate through each character once, so O(n).
- Decode: We iterate through the encoded string once, so O(n).

Space Complexity: O(n)

- Encode: We create a new string with additional length information, but it's still O(n).
- Decode: We create a new list of strings, which in total will have the same length as the original input, so O(n).

Intuition and invariants:

- By prefixing each string with its length, we create an unambiguous way to separate strings.
- The '#' delimiter serves as a clear boundary between the length prefix and the string content.
- This approach works because:
  1. The length is always a number, so we can safely use a non-digit character ('#') as a delimiter.
  2. Knowing the exact length of each string allows us to extract it without needing to search for an end delimiter.

##### Chunked transfer encoding

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string."""
        # Use chunked transfer encoding style
        return ''.join(f"{len(s):x}\r\n{s}\r\n" for s in strs) + "0\r\n\r\n"

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings."""
        result = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(s) - 4:  # -4 to account for the final "0\r\n\r\n"
            # Find the end of the length field
            j = s.index('\r\n', i)
            # Extract and parse the length
            length = int(s[i:j], 16)
            if length == 0:
                break
            # Extract the string content
            result.append(s[j+2 : j+2+length])
            # Move to the start of the next chunk
            i = j + 2 + length + 2
        return result
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total length of all strings.

- Encode: We iterate through each character once, so O(n).
- Decode: We iterate through the encoded string once, so O(n).

Space Complexity: O(n)

- Encode: We create a new string with additional metadata, but it's still O(n).
- Decode: We create a new list of strings, which in total will have the same length as the original input, so O(n).

Intuition and invariants:

- This approach is inspired by the chunked transfer encoding used in HTTP.
- Each string is treated as a "chunk" with its length (in hexadecimal) prefixed.
- The "\r\n" sequence serves as a delimiter between metadata and content.
- A chunk of size 0 indicates the end of the encoded string.
- This method is particularly robust because:
  1. It can handle any byte sequence in the strings, including null bytes and newlines.
  2. The hexadecimal length prefix and "\r\n" delimiters create an unambiguous parsing scheme.

##### Base64 encoding with custom separator

```python
import base64

class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string."""
        # Encode each string to Base64 and join with a custom separator
        return '|'.join(base64.b64encode(s.encode()).decode() for s in strs)

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings."""
        # Split by separator and decode each Base64 string
        return [base64.b64decode(part.encode()).decode() for part in s.split('|')]
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total length of all strings.

- Encode: Base64 encoding is a linear-time operation, and we do it for each string, so O(n).
- Decode: Base64 decoding is also linear-time, and we do it for each encoded string, so O(n).

Space Complexity: O(n)

- Encode: Base64 encoding increases the size by about 33%, but this is still O(n).
- Decode: We create a new list of strings, which will have approximately the same total length as the original input, so O(n).

Intuition and invariants:

- Base64 encoding ensures that the encoded strings only contain a subset of ASCII characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /).
- This allows us to safely use a character outside this set ('|') as a separator.
- The key insights are:
  1. Base64 encoding creates a "safe" string that doesn't contain our chosen separator.
  2. The encoding is reversible, preserving all original information.
  3. By using a separator, we maintain the ability to handle empty strings and preserve the original string boundaries.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Simple delimiter-based approach: Using a fixed character (e.g., ',') to separate strings fails because this character could appear in the input strings, leading to ambiguity in decoding.

2. Fixed-width encoding: Padding each string to a fixed width (e.g., 200 characters) would work but is highly inefficient for variable-length strings, especially when many strings are short.

3. Compression-based approaches: While compression could reduce the size of the encoded string, it's not guaranteed to be reversible for all inputs, especially for short strings or strings with high entropy.

4. JSON serialization: While this would work, it's explicitly disallowed by the problem statement (no serialize methods).

#### Final Recommendations

The length prefixing with delimiter approach (Neetcode solution) is the best to learn for several reasons:

1. Simplicity: It's straightforward to understand and implement.
2. Efficiency: It has optimal time and space complexity.
3. Robustness: It can handle any valid input, including empty strings and strings with special characters.
4. No dependencies: It doesn't rely on external libraries or encoding schemes.

While the chunked transfer encoding and Base64 approaches are also valid and have their merits, they add complexity that isn't necessary for this specific problem. The length prefixing approach strikes the best balance between simplicity, efficiency, and robustness.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the length prefixing with delimiter approach, let's consider encoding the list `["Hello", "World"]`:

```
Input: ["Hello", "World"]

Encoding process:
1. "Hello" -> length = 5 -> "5#Hello"
2. "World" -> length = 5 -> "5#World"

Encoded string: "5#Hello5#World"

Decoding process:
1. Read "5" -> Extract 5 characters after "#" -> "Hello"
2. Read "5" -> Extract 5 characters after "#" -> "World"

Output: ["Hello", "World"]
```

This visualization demonstrates how the length prefix and delimiter work together to unambiguously separate the strings, allowing for easy encoding and decoding.
