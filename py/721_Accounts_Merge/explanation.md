# Explanation: Accounts Merge

## Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is fundamentally about grouping related accounts based on shared emails. The key characteristics and challenges of this problem are:

1. Graph-like structure: The accounts and emails form a graph-like structure where emails are the connecting edges between accounts.
2. Disjoint Set problem: We need to find connected components in this graph, which is a classic application of the Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure.
3. Name collision: Multiple people can have the same name, so we can't merge accounts based on names alone.
4. Email uniqueness: An email can only belong to one person, which is crucial for merging accounts.
5. Sorting requirement: The final output requires emails to be sorted within each account.
6. Variable input size: The number of accounts and emails per account can vary significantly.

The key principle that makes this question tractable is that we can use emails as unique identifiers to connect accounts, regardless of the names associated with them. This allows us to transform the problem into a graph connectivity problem, which can be efficiently solved using disjoint set operations.

### Test cases

Let's define some test cases to cover various scenarios:

1. Basic case with merging:

```python
accounts = [
    ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
    ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
    ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"],
    ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"]
]
# Expected: [
#     ["John", "john00@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com", "johnsmith@mail.com"],
#     ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"],
#     ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"]
# ]
```

2. No merging required:

```python
accounts = [
    ["Gabe", "Gabe0@m.co", "Gabe3@m.co", "Gabe1@m.co"],
    ["Kevin", "Kevin3@m.co", "Kevin5@m.co", "Kevin0@m.co"],
    ["Ethan", "Ethan5@m.co", "Ethan4@m.co", "Ethan0@m.co"]
]
# Expected: (same as input, but with emails sorted)
```

3. All accounts merge into one:

```python
accounts = [
    ["John", "a@mail.com", "b@mail.com"],
    ["John", "b@mail.com", "c@mail.com"],
    ["John", "c@mail.com", "d@mail.com"]
]
# Expected: [["John", "a@mail.com", "b@mail.com", "c@mail.com", "d@mail.com"]]
```

4. Same name, different people:

```python
accounts = [
    ["David", "David0@m.co", "David1@m.co"],
    ["David", "David3@m.co", "David4@m.co"],
    ["David", "David4@m.co", "David5@m.co"],
    ["David", "David2@m.co", "David3@m.co"],
    ["David", "David1@m.co", "David2@m.co"]
]
# Expected: [
#     ["David", "David0@m.co", "David1@m.co", "David2@m.co", "David3@m.co", "David4@m.co", "David5@m.co"]
# ]
```

5. Edge case with single email:

```python
accounts = [["Alex", "alex@m.co"], ["Bob", "bob@m.co"]]
# Expected: (same as input)
```

Here's the Python code to run these test cases:

```python
def accountsMerge(accounts):
    # Implementation goes here
    pass

test_cases = [
    [
        ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
        ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
        ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"],
        ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"]
    ],
    [
        ["Gabe", "Gabe0@m.co", "Gabe3@m.co", "Gabe1@m.co"],
        ["Kevin", "Kevin3@m.co", "Kevin5@m.co", "Kevin0@m.co"],
        ["Ethan", "Ethan5@m.co", "Ethan4@m.co", "Ethan0@m.co"]
    ],
    [
        ["John", "a@mail.com", "b@mail.com"],
        ["John", "b@mail.com", "c@mail.com"],
        ["John", "c@mail.com", "d@mail.com"]
    ],
    [
        ["David", "David0@m.co", "David1@m.co"],
        ["David", "David3@m.co", "David4@m.co"],
        ["David", "David4@m.co", "David5@m.co"],
        ["David", "David2@m.co", "David3@m.co"],
        ["David", "David1@m.co", "David2@m.co"]
    ],
    [["Alex", "alex@m.co"], ["Bob", "bob@m.co"]]
]

for i, case in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
    print(f"Test Case {i}:")
    print("Input:", case)
    print("Output:", accountsMerge(case))
    print()
```

### Worthy Solutions

#### 1. Disjoint Set (Union-Find) with sorting

This approach uses a Disjoint Set data structure to efficiently group related emails.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class DisjointSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parent = {}

    def find(self, item):
        if item not in self.parent:
            self.parent[item] = item
        elif self.parent[item] != item:
            self.parent[item] = self.find(self.parent[item])
        return self.parent[item]

    def union(self, item1, item2):
        root1, root2 = self.find(item1), self.find(item2)
        if root1 != root2:
            self.parent[root2] = root1

def accountsMerge(accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
    disjoint_set = DisjointSet()
    email_to_name = {}

    # Step 1: Build the disjoint set
    for account in accounts:
        name = account[0]
        # Union all emails in this account
        for email in account[1:]:
            disjoint_set.union(account[1], email)
            email_to_name[email] = name

    # Step 2: Group emails by their root in the disjoint set
    email_groups = defaultdict(list)
    for email in email_to_name:
        root = disjoint_set.find(email)
        email_groups[root].append(email)

    # Step 3: Format the result
    result = []
    for emails in email_groups.values():
        name = email_to_name[emails[0]]
        result.append([name] + sorted(emails))

    return result
```

Time Complexity: O(N _K_ log(N \* K)), where N is the number of accounts and K is the maximum number of emails in an account. The log factor comes from the union and find operations in the disjoint set.

Space Complexity: O(N \* K) to store the disjoint set and email groups.

Intuitions and invariants:

- Each email is a node in our disjoint set.
- Emails in the same account are connected (unioned) in the disjoint set.
- The root email of each set in the disjoint set represents a unique person.
- We maintain a mapping from emails to names to reconstruct the final result.

#### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS) with adjacency list

This approach builds a graph where emails are nodes and accounts provide the edges.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def accountsMerge(accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    email_to_name = {}
    for account in accounts:
        name = account[0]
        for email in account[1:]:
            graph[account[1]].add(email)
            graph[email].add(account[1])
            email_to_name[email] = name

    # DFS function to explore connected components
    def dfs(email, component):
        if email in visited:
            return
        visited.add(email)
        component.append(email)
        for neighbor in graph[email]:
            dfs(neighbor, component)

    # Perform DFS for each email
    visited = set()
    result = []
    for email in graph:
        if email not in visited:
            component = []
            dfs(email, component)
            result.append([email_to_name[email]] + sorted(component))

    return result
```

Time Complexity: O(N _K_ log(N \* K)), where N is the number of accounts and K is the maximum number of emails in an account. The log factor comes from sorting the emails.

Space Complexity: O(N \* K) to store the graph and visited set.

Intuitions and invariants:

- Each email is a node in our graph.
- Emails in the same account are connected by edges.
- A connected component in this graph represents all emails belonging to one person.
- DFS explores all connected emails, forming a single merged account.

#### 3. Breadth-First Search (BFS) with adjacency list

This approach is similar to DFS but uses BFS to explore connected components.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def accountsMerge(accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    email_to_name = {}
    for account in accounts:
        name = account[0]
        for email in account[1:]:
            graph[account[1]].add(email)
            graph[email].add(account[1])
            email_to_name[email] = name

    # BFS function to explore connected components
    def bfs(start_email):
        queue = deque([start_email])
        component = []
        while queue:
            email = queue.popleft()
            if email in visited:
                continue
            visited.add(email)
            component.append(email)
            queue.extend(graph[email] - visited)
        return component

    # Perform BFS for each email
    visited = set()
    result = []
    for email in graph:
        if email not in visited:
            component = bfs(email)
            result.append([email_to_name[email]] + sorted(component))

    return result
```

Time Complexity: O(N _K_ log(N \* K)), where N is the number of accounts and K is the maximum number of emails in an account. The log factor comes from sorting the emails.

Space Complexity: O(N \* K) to store the graph and queue.

Intuitions and invariants:

- Similar to DFS, but explores nodes level by level.
- Guarantees shortest path exploration (though not needed for this problem).
- May be more memory-efficient than DFS for very deep graphs (not a significant factor here).

### Rejected Approaches

1. Brute Force comparison of all accounts:

   - Time Complexity: O(N^2 \* K^2), where N is the number of accounts and K is the max number of emails.
   - Reason for rejection: Highly inefficient for large datasets, doesn't leverage the graph-like structure of the problem.

2. Hash-based grouping without graph structure:
   - Approach: Use a hash map to group emails, then merge groups with common emails.
   - Reason for rejection: While this could work, it's less intuitive and potentially less efficient than graph-based approaches for complex merging scenarios.

### Final Recommendations

The Disjoint Set (Union-Find) approach is recommended as the best solution to learn for this problem. Here's why:

1. Efficiency: It provides near-constant time complexity for union and find operations, making it very efficient for large datasets.
2. Intuitive mapping to the problem: The concept of merging accounts naturally maps to the union operation in disjoint sets.
3. Widely applicable: Disjoint Set is a fundamental data structure used in many graph and set-related problems, making it valuable to master.

The DFS and BFS approaches are also correct and worth understanding, as they provide insights into graph traversal techniques. However, they may be slightly less efficient due to the need for explicit graph construction and traversal.

Approaches that might seem correct but aren't:

1. Simply grouping by name: This fails because different people can have the same name.
2. Merging accounts only if they share all emails: This is too strict and would miss partial overlaps.

Solutions that are correct but less worth learning:

1. Brute force comparison of all pairs of accounts: While correct, it's highly inefficient and doesn't scale well.
2. Using a complex data structure like a Trie for email matching: While it could work, it's overly complicated for this problem and doesn't offer significant advantages over simpler approaches.

## Visualization(s)

To visualize the Disjoint Set approach, we can use a simple tree-like structure to represent the sets. Here's an ASCII representation of how the disjoint set might look for a simple case:

```
Initial state:
John --- johnsmith@mail.com
 |
 +--- john_newyork@mail.com
 |
John --- johnsmith@mail.com
 |
 +--- john00@mail.com
 |
Mary --- mary@mail.com
 |
John --- johnnybravo@mail.com

After merging:
John --- johnsmith@mail.com
 |       |
 |       +--- john_newyork@mail.com
 |       |
 |       +--- john00@mail.com
 |
Mary --- mary@mail.com
 |
John --- johnnybravo@mail.com
```

This visualization shows how the Disjoint Set structure groups related emails under a common root, effectively merging the accounts.
