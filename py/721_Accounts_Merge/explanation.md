## Explanation: Accounts Merge

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is fundamentally about finding connected components in a graph, where each email address is a node and two email addresses are connected if they belong to the same account. The key insights are:

1. Email addresses are unique identifiers for accounts.
2. The same person can have multiple email addresses.
3. Different people can have the same name.
4. The goal is to merge accounts belonging to the same person.

This problem maps well to the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure, which is optimal for grouping elements into sets and efficiently finding which set an element belongs to. The key principle that makes this question simple is that Union-Find provides near-constant time operations for merging sets and checking if two elements belong to the same set.

Alternatively, this can be solved using a graph-based approach with Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), where we build an adjacency list representing connections between email addresses and then traverse the graph to find connected components.

### Test cases

1. Basic case with merging:

   ```python
   accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
               ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
               ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"],
               ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
   ```

2. No merging required:

   ```python
   accounts = [["Gabe", "Gabe0@m.co", "Gabe3@m.co", "Gabe1@m.co"],
               ["Kevin", "Kevin3@m.co", "Kevin5@m.co", "Kevin0@m.co"]]
   ```

3. All accounts merge into one:

   ```python
   accounts = [["John", "a@mail.com"],
               ["John", "b@mail.com"],
               ["John", "a@mail.com", "c@mail.com"]]
   ```

4. Same name, different people:

   ```python
   accounts = [["David", "David0@m.co", "David1@m.co"],
               ["David", "David3@m.co", "David4@m.co"],
               ["David", "David4@m.co", "David5@m.co"],
               ["David", "David2@m.co", "David3@m.co"],
               ["David", "David1@m.co", "David2@m.co"]]
   ```

5. Large number of accounts (edge case for performance):

   ```python
   accounts = [["Person"+str(i), "email"+str(i)+"@domain.com"] for i in range(1000)]
   ```

Here's the executable Python code for these test cases:

```python
def test_accounts_merge(merge_accounts_func):
    test_cases = [
        [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
         ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
         ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"],
         ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"]],

        [["Gabe", "Gabe0@m.co", "Gabe3@m.co", "Gabe1@m.co"],
         ["Kevin", "Kevin3@m.co", "Kevin5@m.co", "Kevin0@m.co"]],

        [["John", "a@mail.com"],
         ["John", "b@mail.com"],
         ["John", "a@mail.com", "c@mail.com"]],

        [["David", "David0@m.co", "David1@m.co"],
         ["David", "David3@m.co", "David4@m.co"],
         ["David", "David4@m.co", "David5@m.co"],
         ["David", "David2@m.co", "David3@m.co"],
         ["David", "David1@m.co", "David2@m.co"]],

        [["Person"+str(i), "email"+str(i)+"@domain.com"] for i in range(1000)]
    ]

    for i, case in enumerate(test_cases):
        result = merge_accounts_func(case)
        print(f"Test case {i+1} result:")
        for account in result:
            print(account)
        print()

# Usage:
# test_accounts_merge(your_merge_accounts_function)
```

##### Union-Find (Disjoint Set) approach

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:  # Union by rank
            self.parent[px] = py
        elif self.rank[px] > self.rank[py]:
            self.parent[py] = px
        else:
            self.parent[py] = px
            self.rank[px] += 1

def accountsMerge(accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
    email_to_id = {}
    email_to_name = {}

    # Assign unique ID to each email
    for account in accounts:
        name = account[0]
        for email in account[1:]:
            if email not in email_to_id:
                email_to_id[email] = len(email_to_id)
            email_to_name[email] = name

    # Create UnionFind structure
    uf = UnionFind(len(email_to_id))

    # Union emails belonging to the same account
    for account in accounts:
        first_email = account[1]
        for email in account[2:]:
            uf.union(email_to_id[first_email], email_to_id[email])

    # Group emails by their representative (root) in UnionFind
    merged_accounts = defaultdict(list)
    for email, id in email_to_id.items():
        root = uf.find(id)
        merged_accounts[root].append(email)

    # Format the result
    return [[email_to_name[emails[0]]] + sorted(emails) for emails in merged_accounts.values()]
```

Time Complexity: O(N \* α(N)), where N is the total number of emails and α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly and is effectively constant for all practical values of N.
Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of emails.

Explanation:

- The UnionFind operations (find and union) have an amortized time complexity of O(α(N)) due to path compression and union by rank optimizations.
- We iterate through all emails once to create the UnionFind structure and once more to group them, both of which are O(N) operations.
- Sorting the emails in each group adds a factor of O(M log M) where M is the number of emails in a group, but since ΣM = N, this is bounded by O(N log N).

Intuitions and invariants:

- Each email address is treated as a node in the UnionFind structure.
- Emails belonging to the same account are unioned together.
- The representative (root) of each set in UnionFind corresponds to a unique person.
- Path compression and union by rank optimizations keep the tree structure flat, ensuring near-constant time operations.

##### Graph-based approach with DFS

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def accountsMerge(accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
    # Build the graph: email -> set of connected emails
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    email_to_name = {}

    for account in accounts:
        name = account[0]
        # Connect all emails in this account
        for email in account[1:]:
            graph[account[1]].add(email)
            graph[email].add(account[1])
            email_to_name[email] = name

    # DFS function to collect all connected emails
    def dfs(email, connected_emails):
        if email in connected_emails:
            return
        connected_emails.add(email)
        for neighbor in graph[email]:
            dfs(neighbor, connected_emails)

    # Perform DFS for each email
    merged_accounts = []
    visited = set()
    for email in graph:
        if email not in visited:
            connected_emails = set()
            dfs(email, connected_emails)
            merged_accounts.append([email_to_name[email]] + sorted(connected_emails))
            visited.update(connected_emails)

    return merged_accounts
```

Time Complexity: O(NE log(E)), where N is the number of accounts and E is the maximum number of emails in an account.
Space Complexity: O(NE), where N is the number of accounts and E is the maximum number of emails in an account.

Explanation:

- Building the graph takes O(NE) time, where we iterate through each email in each account.
- The DFS traversal visits each email once, which is O(NE) in total.
- Sorting the emails for each merged account takes O(E log E) time.
- In the worst case, if all emails belong to the same account, we would sort all NE emails, giving us O(NE log(NE)) time complexity.

Intuitions and invariants:

- The graph represents connections between emails, where connected emails belong to the same person.
- DFS traversal ensures we find all connected components (i.e., all emails belonging to the same person).
- Each connected component in the graph represents a unique person's account.
- The first email encountered in a connected component is used to retrieve the person's name.

##### Graph-based approach with BFS

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def accountsMerge(accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
    # Build the graph: email -> set of connected emails
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    email_to_name = {}

    for account in accounts:
        name = account[0]
        # Connect all emails in this account
        for email in account[1:]:
            graph[account[1]].add(email)
            graph[email].add(account[1])
            email_to_name[email] = name

    # BFS function to collect all connected emails
    def bfs(start_email):
        queue = deque([start_email])
        connected_emails = set()
        while queue:
            email = queue.popleft()
            if email in connected_emails:
                continue
            connected_emails.add(email)
            queue.extend(graph[email] - connected_emails)
        return connected_emails

    # Perform BFS for each email
    merged_accounts = []
    visited = set()
    for email in graph:
        if email not in visited:
            connected_emails = bfs(email)
            merged_accounts.append([email_to_name[email]] + sorted(connected_emails))
            visited.update(connected_emails)

    return merged_accounts
```

Time Complexity: O(NE log(E)), where N is the number of accounts and E is the maximum number of emails in an account.
Space Complexity: O(NE), where N is the number of accounts and E is the maximum number of emails in an account.

Explanation:

- Building the graph takes O(NE) time, iterating through each email in each account.
- The BFS traversal visits each email once, which is O(NE) in total.
- Sorting the emails for each merged account takes O(E log E) time.
- In the worst case, if all emails belong to the same account, we would sort all NE emails, giving us O(NE log(NE)) time complexity.

Intuitions and invariants:

- The graph represents connections between emails, where connected emails belong to the same person.
- BFS traversal ensures we find all connected components (i.e., all emails belonging to the same person) in a breadth-first manner.
- Each connected component in the graph represents a unique person's account.
- The queue in BFS ensures we explore all directly connected emails before moving to the next level of connections.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Brute force comparison of all accounts:

   - This approach would involve comparing each account with every other account to find common emails.
   - Time complexity would be O(N^2 \* E^2), where N is the number of accounts and E is the maximum number of emails in an account.
   - This is highly inefficient for large datasets and doesn't leverage the structure of the problem.

2. Sorting and comparing adjacent accounts:
   - This approach would sort all accounts based on email addresses and then compare adjacent accounts.
   - While this might work, it has a time complexity of O(NE log(NE)) for sorting, which is less efficient than our accepted solutions.
   - It also doesn't naturally capture the transitive property of account connections (if A is connected to B, and B to C, then A is connected to C).

#### Final Recommendations

The Union-Find approach is the most recommended solution for this problem. Here's why:

1. Efficiency: It provides near-constant time operations for merging accounts and checking if two emails belong to the same account, making it the most efficient solution, especially for large datasets.

2. Intuitive: The concept of merging sets aligns well with the problem of merging accounts, making the solution conceptually clear.

3. Versatility: Union-Find is a fundamental data structure used in many graph and set-based problems, making it a valuable technique to master for coding interviews.

4. Space Efficiency: It uses less additional space compared to the graph-based approaches, as it doesn't need to store explicit connections between all emails.

While the DFS and BFS approaches are valid and demonstrate good problem-solving skills, they are slightly less efficient and require more complex data structures (graph representation). However, they are still worth understanding as they showcase different problem-solving paradigms and can be more intuitive for some people.

### Visualization(s)

For this problem, a visualization of the Union-Find structure or the graph of email connections would be helpful. Here's a simple ASCII representation of how emails might be connected:

```
         johnsmith@mail.com
        /                  \
john_newyork@mail.com    john00@mail.com

         mary@mail.com

         johnnybravo@mail.com
```

This visualization shows how emails are grouped together, with each connected component representing a unique person's account. The Union-Find structure would maintain these groupings efficiently, while the graph-based approaches would traverse these connections to merge accounts.
