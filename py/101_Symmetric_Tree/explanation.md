Certainly! Let's tackle this problem and provide solutions using both recursive and iterative approaches. We'll analyze their time and space complexities, provide visualizations where helpful, and include test cases.

Let's start with the recursive solution, as it's often more intuitive for tree problems.

1. Recursive Solution:

```python
from typing import Optional

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True

        def isMirror(left: Optional[TreeNode], right: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
            # If both nodes are None, they're symmetric
            if not left and not right:
                return True

            # If one node is None and the other isn't, they're not symmetric
            if not left or not right:
                return False

            # Check if the values are the same and if subtrees are mirrors
            return (left.val == right.val and
                    isMirror(left.left, right.right) and
                    isMirror(left.right, right.left))

        # Start the recursion with the left and right subtrees of the root
        return isMirror(root.left, root.right)

# Test cases
def test_symmetric_tree():
    # Test case 1: Symmetric tree
    root1 = TreeNode(1)
    root1.left = TreeNode(2)
    root1.right = TreeNode(2)
    root1.left.left = TreeNode(3)
    root1.left.right = TreeNode(4)
    root1.right.left = TreeNode(4)
    root1.right.right = TreeNode(3)

    # Test case 2: Non-symmetric tree
    root2 = TreeNode(1)
    root2.left = TreeNode(2)
    root2.right = TreeNode(2)
    root2.left.right = TreeNode(3)
    root2.right.right = TreeNode(3)

    solution = Solution()
    print("Test case 1 (Symmetric):", solution.isSymmetric(root1))  # Expected: True
    print("Test case 2 (Non-symmetric):", solution.isSymmetric(root2))  # Expected: False

test_symmetric_tree()

```

Explanation of the recursive solution:

1. We define a helper function `isMirror` that takes two nodes as input.
2. The base cases are:
   - If both nodes are None, they're symmetric.
   - If one node is None and the other isn't, they're not symmetric.
3. For non-None nodes, we check if their values are equal and recursively check if their subtrees are mirrors of each other.
4. The main `isSymmetric` function starts the recursion with the left and right subtrees of the root.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
Space Complexity: O(h) in the best and average case, where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, it could be O(n).

Now, let's look at an iterative solution using a queue:

```python
from typing import Optional
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True

        queue = deque([(root.left, root.right)])

        while queue:
            left, right = queue.popleft()

            if not left and not right:
                continue

            if not left or not right:
                return False

            if left.val != right.val:
                return False

            # Add the outer pairs
            queue.append((left.left, right.right))
            # Add the inner pairs
            queue.append((left.right, right.left))

        return True

# Test cases (same as before)
def test_symmetric_tree():
    # Test case 1: Symmetric tree
    root1 = TreeNode(1)
    root1.left = TreeNode(2)
    root1.right = TreeNode(2)
    root1.left.left = TreeNode(3)
    root1.left.right = TreeNode(4)
    root1.right.left = TreeNode(4)
    root1.right.right = TreeNode(3)

    # Test case 2: Non-symmetric tree
    root2 = TreeNode(1)
    root2.left = TreeNode(2)
    root2.right = TreeNode(2)
    root2.left.right = TreeNode(3)
    root2.right.right = TreeNode(3)

    solution = Solution()
    print("Test case 1 (Symmetric):", solution.isSymmetric(root1))  # Expected: True
    print("Test case 2 (Non-symmetric):", solution.isSymmetric(root2))  # Expected: False

test_symmetric_tree()

```

Explanation of the iterative solution:

1. We use a queue to store pairs of nodes that we need to compare.
2. We start by adding the pair (root.left, root.right) to the queue.
3. While the queue is not empty, we:
   - Pop a pair of nodes from the queue.
   - If both are None, we continue to the next pair.
   - If one is None and the other isn't, or if their values are different, we return False.
   - Otherwise, we add the outer and inner pairs of their children to the queue.
4. If we've processed all pairs without returning False, the tree is symmetric.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
Space Complexity: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case, this could be O(n) for a complete binary tree.

To help visualize the algorithm, let's create a simple React component that demonstrates how the iterative solution works on a symmetric tree:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const TreeNode = ({ value, x, y, highlighted }) => (
  <g transform={`translate(${x},${y})`}>
    <circle r="20" fill={highlighted ? "yellow" : "white"} stroke="black" />
    <text textAnchor="middle" dy=".3em">
      {value}
    </text>
  </g>
);

const TreeEdge = ({ x1, y1, x2, y2 }) => (
  <line x1={x1} y1={y1} x2={x2} y2={y2} stroke="black" />
);

const SymmetricTreeVisualization = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
  const treeData = [
    { id: 1, value: 1, x: 200, y: 50 },
    { id: 2, value: 2, x: 100, y: 100 },
    { id: 3, value: 2, x: 300, y: 100 },
    { id: 4, value: 3, x: 50, y: 150 },
    { id: 5, value: 4, x: 150, y: 150 },
    { id: 6, value: 4, x: 250, y: 150 },
    { id: 7, value: 3, x: 350, y: 150 },
  ];

  const edges = [
    { from: 1, to: 2 },
    { from: 1, to: 3 },
    { from: 2, to: 4 },
    { from: 2, to: 5 },
    { from: 3, to: 6 },
    { from: 3, to: 7 },
  ];

  const steps = [
    [2, 3],
    [4, 7],
    [5, 6],
    [4, 7],
    [5, 6],
  ];

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setStep((prevStep) => (prevStep + 1) % steps.length);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [step]);

  return (
    <div>
      <svg width="400" height="200">
        {edges.map((edge, index) => {
          const from = treeData.find((node) => node.id === edge.from);
          const to = treeData.find((node) => node.id === edge.to);
          return (
            <TreeEdge key={index} x1={from.x} y1={from.y} x2={to.x} y2={to.y} />
          );
        })}
        {treeData.map((node) => (
          <TreeNode
            key={node.id}
            value={node.value}
            x={node.x}
            y={node.y}
            highlighted={steps[step].includes(node.id)}
          />
        ))}
      </svg>
      <p>
        Step {step + 1}: Comparing nodes {steps[step].join(" and ")}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SymmetricTreeVisualization;
```

This visualization demonstrates how the iterative algorithm compares pairs of nodes. The yellow highlighted nodes show which pair is being compared at each step.

Recommendation:
Both the recursive and iterative solutions have their merits:

1. The recursive solution is more intuitive and easier to understand at a glance. It directly mirrors the problem's recursive nature.
2. The iterative solution can be more efficient in terms of space complexity for very deep trees, as it doesn't risk stack overflow.

For interviews and general understanding, I would recommend learning the recursive solution first. It's more straightforward and often easier to come up with during an interview. However, it's valuable to understand both approaches, as the interviewer might ask for an iterative solution or discuss the trade-offs between the two.

In practice, the choice between recursive and iterative solutions often depends on the specific requirements of the system you're working with (e.g., stack size limitations, performance requirements for very large trees, etc.).

Would you like me to explain any part of these solutions in more detail?
