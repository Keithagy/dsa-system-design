## Explanation: Basic Calculator II

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is about evaluating a mathematical expression given as a string. The key characteristics of the problem are:

1. The expression consists of non-negative integers and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /).
2. The expression may contain spaces, which should be ignored.
3. The operators have different precedence: multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
4. Integer division should truncate toward zero.
5. The expression is always valid, so we don't need to worry about error handling for invalid inputs.

The main challenge in this problem is handling operator precedence correctly. This is a classic problem that can be solved using either a stack-based approach or by simulating the order of operations.

The key principle that makes this question simple is the fact that we can process the expression in a single pass from left to right, keeping track of the last number and operation, and only performing calculations when necessary based on operator precedence.

### Test cases

Here are some relevant test cases:

1. Basic operations: "3+2\*2" (Output: 7)
2. Division with truncation: " 3/2 " (Output: 1)
3. Mixed operations: " 3+5 / 2 " (Output: 5)
4. Multiple operations with same precedence: "1+1+1" (Output: 3)
5. Operations with different precedence: "1+2*3+4*5" (Output: 27)
6. Expression with spaces: " 2-1 + 2 " (Output: 3)
7. Expression with only one number: "42" (Output: 42)
8. Expression with large numbers: "1000000000/1000000000" (Output: 1)

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def calculate(s: str) -> int:
    # Implementation goes here
    pass

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    "3+2*2",
    " 3/2 ",
    " 3+5 / 2 ",
    "1+1+1",
    "1+2*3+4*5",
    " 2-1 + 2 ",
    "42",
    "1000000000/1000000000"
]

for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {calculate(case)}")
    print()
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Stack-based approach (Neetcode solution)

```python
def calculate(s: str) -> int:
    stack = []
    num = 0
    sign = '+'

    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char.isdigit():
            num = num * 10 + int(char)

        if (not char.isdigit() and char != ' ') or i == len(s) - 1:
            if sign == '+':
                stack.append(num)
            elif sign == '-':
                stack.append(-num)
            elif sign == '*':
                stack.append(stack.pop() * num)
            elif sign == '/':
                stack.append(int(stack.pop() / num))  # truncate toward zero

            num = 0
            sign = char

    return sum(stack)
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where the expression consists only of additions and subtractions, causing all numbers to be pushed onto the stack.

- The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of numbers and intermediate results.
- It processes the string character by character, building up numbers digit by digit.
- When an operator is encountered (or at the end of the string), it performs the operation based on the previous operator.
- Multiplication and division are performed immediately, while addition and subtraction are deferred by pushing onto the stack.
- The final result is the sum of all numbers in the stack.

##### Two-pass approach with operator precedence

```python
def calculate(s: str) -> int:
    def update(op, v):
        if op == "+": stack.append(v)
        if op == "-": stack.append(-v)
        if op == "*": stack.append(stack.pop() * v)
        if op == "/": stack.append(int(stack.pop() / v))  # truncate toward zero

    it, num, stack, sign = 0, 0, [], "+"

    # First pass: handle multiplication and division
    while it < len(s):
        if s[it].isdigit():
            num = num * 10 + int(s[it])
        elif s[it] in "*/":
            update(sign, num)
            num, sign = 0, s[it]
        elif s[it] in "+-":
            update(sign, num)
            num, sign = 0, s[it]
        it += 1
    update(sign, num)

    # Second pass: handle addition and subtraction
    return sum(stack)
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We make two passes through the data.
Space Complexity: O(n) to store the intermediate results in the stack.

- This approach separates the handling of multiplication/division and addition/subtraction.
- In the first pass, it performs multiplication and division immediately.
- Addition and subtraction are deferred by pushing numbers onto the stack.
- The second pass simply sums up the stack to get the final result.
- This method more closely mimics the order of operations in arithmetic.

##### One-pass approach without stack

```python
def calculate(s: str) -> int:
    s += '+0'  # Add a dummy operation at the end to process the last number
    num, stack, sign = 0, 0, '+'

    for char in s:
        if char.isdigit():
            num = num * 10 + int(char)
        elif char in '+-*/':
            if sign == '+':
                stack += num
            elif sign == '-':
                stack -= num
            elif sign == '*':
                stack *= num
            elif sign == '/':
                # Handle division by zero
                stack = int(stack / num) if num != 0 else float('inf')
            num, sign = 0, char

    return stack
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

- This approach processes the expression in a single pass without using a stack.
- It keeps track of the current number, the running total (stack), and the last seen operator.
- When a new operator is encountered, it performs the previous operation immediately.
- By adding a dummy operation at the end, we ensure the last number is processed.
- This method is memory-efficient but may be slightly harder to understand at first glance.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Using eval() function: This is explicitly disallowed by the problem statement. Moreover, it's generally unsafe as it can execute arbitrary code.

2. Recursive descent parser: While this would work, it's overly complex for this problem. The expression doesn't include parentheses or more complex structures that would warrant a full parser.

3. Shunting yard algorithm: This algorithm is typically used for more complex expressions, especially those with parentheses. For this problem, it would be overkill and less efficient than the simpler stack-based or one-pass approaches.

#### Final Recommendations

The stack-based approach (Neetcode solution) is the best to learn for several reasons:

1. It's intuitive and closely mimics how we would evaluate the expression manually.
2. It handles operator precedence elegantly without needing multiple passes.
3. It's efficient in both time and space complexity.
4. It's a versatile approach that can be extended to handle more complex expressions (e.g., with parentheses) with minimal modifications.

While the one-pass approach is more space-efficient, the stack-based method is easier to understand and explain in an interview setting. It also demonstrates a good understanding of data structures and how they can be applied to solve problems.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the stack-based approach, we can use a simple ASCII art representation:

```
Expression: 3 + 2 * 2

Step 1: [3]         (push 3)
Step 2: [3]         (encounter +, keep 3 on stack)
Step 3: [3, 2]      (push 2)
Step 4: [3, 4]      (encounter *, pop 2, multiply by 2, push 4)
Step 5: sum([3, 4]) = 7
```

This visualization helps to show how the stack is used to manage operator precedence and intermediate results.
