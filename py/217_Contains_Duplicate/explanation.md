Certainly! Let's explore different solutions to the "Contains Duplicate" problem and analyze their time and space complexities.

Solution 1: Using a Set

```python
from typing import List

def contains_duplicate(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Create a set to store unique numbers
    unique_nums = set()

    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # If the number is already in the set, we've found a duplicate
        if num in unique_nums:
            return True
        # Otherwise, add the number to the set
        unique_nums.add(num)

    # If we've gone through all numbers without finding a duplicate, return False
    return False

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [1, 2, 3, 1],
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]
]

for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {contains_duplicate(case)}")
    print()

```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list. We iterate through the list once.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where all elements are unique and we store them all in the set.

Solution 2: Sorting the Array

```python
from typing import List

def contains_duplicate(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Sort the input list
    nums.sort()

    # Iterate through the sorted list, comparing adjacent elements
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            return True

    # If no duplicates found, return False
    return False

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [1, 2, 3, 1],
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]
]

for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {contains_duplicate(case)}")
    print()

```

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.
Space Complexity: O(1) if we're allowed to modify the input array, or O(n) if we need to create a copy for sorting.

Solution 3: Using a Dictionary (Hash Map)

```python
from typing import List

def contains_duplicate(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Create a dictionary to store number counts
    num_counts = {}

    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # If the number is already in the dictionary, we've found a duplicate
        if num in num_counts:
            return True
        # Otherwise, add the number to the dictionary
        num_counts[num] = 1

    # If we've gone through all numbers without finding a duplicate, return False
    return False

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [1, 2, 3, 1],
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]
]

for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {contains_duplicate(case)}")
    print()

```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list. We iterate through the list once.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where all elements are unique and we store them all in the dictionary.

Recommendation:
The best solution to learn and use for this problem is Solution 1 (using a Set). Here's why:

1. Time Complexity: It has the optimal time complexity of O(n), which is the best we can achieve for this problem.
2. Space Complexity: While it uses O(n) space, this is necessary to solve the problem in O(n) time.
3. Simplicity: The code is straightforward and easy to understand.
4. Python-specific: Sets in Python are implemented as hash tables, making the `in` operation very efficient (average case O(1)).

The dictionary solution (Solution 3) is equally good in terms of time and space complexity, but sets are more idiomatic for this particular problem in Python.

The sorting solution (Solution 2) is less efficient in terms of time complexity and should be avoided unless there are specific constraints that make it necessary (e.g., if you're not allowed to use additional data structures).

To help visualize how the set-based solution works, let's create a simple diagram:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";

const ContainsDuplicateVisualization = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
  const nums = [1, 2, 3, 1];
  const steps = [
    { set: new Set(), current: null, result: null },
    { set: new Set([1]), current: 1, result: null },
    { set: new Set([1, 2]), current: 2, result: null },
    { set: new Set([1, 2, 3]), current: 3, result: null },
    { set: new Set([1, 2, 3]), current: 1, result: true },
  ];

  const currentStep = steps[step];

  return (
    <Card className="w-full max-w-md mx-auto">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Contains Duplicate Visualization</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="mb-4">
          <p>Input: {JSON.stringify(nums)}</p>
          <p>
            Current number:{" "}
            {currentStep.current !== null ? currentStep.current : "N/A"}
          </p>
          <p>Set: {JSON.stringify([...currentStep.set])}</p>
          <p>
            Result:{" "}
            {currentStep.result !== null ? String(currentStep.result) : "N/A"}
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex justify-between">
          <button
            onClick={() => setStep(Math.max(0, step - 1))}
            disabled={step === 0}
            className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded disabled:bg-gray-300"
          >
            Previous
          </button>
          <button
            onClick={() => setStep(Math.min(steps.length - 1, step + 1))}
            disabled={step === steps.length - 1}
            className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded disabled:bg-gray-300"
          >
            Next
          </button>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default ContainsDuplicateVisualization;
```

This visualization demonstrates how the set-based solution works step by step. You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to walk through the algorithm's execution.

1. We start with an empty set and the input array [1, 2, 3, 1].
2. We add 1 to the set.
3. We add 2 to the set.
4. We add 3 to the set.
5. When we encounter 1 again, we find that it's already in the set, so we return True.

This visual representation helps to understand how the set is used to detect duplicates efficiently.
