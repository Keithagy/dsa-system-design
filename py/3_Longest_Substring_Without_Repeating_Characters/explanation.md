Thank you for providing the problem statement. I'll provide different solutions for the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem, explain their complexities, and recommend the best one to learn.

Let's start with three different approaches:

1. Brute Force
2. Sliding Window with Set
3. Sliding Window with Dictionary

4. Brute Force Approach:

This is the simplest but least efficient approach.

```python
from typing import List

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    def allUnique(start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        # Create a set of characters in the current substring
        char_set = set()
        for i in range(start, end + 1):
            # If character is already in set, it's not unique
            if s[i] in char_set:
                return False
            char_set.add(s[i])
        return True

    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0

    # Check all possible substrings
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if allUnique(i, j):
                max_length = max(max_length, j - i + 1)

    return max_length

# Test cases
test_cases = ["abcabcbb", "bbbbb", "pwwkew", ""]
for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {lengthOfLongestSubstring(case)}")
    print()

```

Explanation:

- Time Complexity: O(n^3), where n is the length of the string. We have two nested loops, and for each substring, we check if it has all unique characters.
- Space Complexity: O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set. In the worst case, we need to create a set with all characters in the string.

This approach is inefficient for large inputs due to its cubic time complexity.

2. Sliding Window with Set:

This approach uses a sliding window technique with a set to keep track of unique characters.

```python
from typing import Set

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set: Set[str] = set()
    max_length = 0
    left = right = 0
    n = len(s)

    while right < n:
        if s[right] not in char_set:
            # If the character is not in the set, add it and move right pointer
            char_set.add(s[right])
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
            right += 1
        else:
            # If the character is in the set, remove the leftmost character and move left pointer
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1

    return max_length

# Test cases
test_cases = ["abcabcbb", "bbbbb", "pwwkew", ""]
for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {lengthOfLongestSubstring(case)}")
    print()

```

Explanation:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once with the right pointer, and the left pointer can move at most n times.
- Space Complexity: O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set. In the worst case, we need to store all characters in the set.

This approach is much more efficient than the brute force method.

3. Sliding Window with Dictionary:

This approach uses a sliding window technique with a dictionary to keep track of the last occurrence of each character.

```python
from typing import Dict

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    char_index: Dict[str, int] = {}  # Dictionary to store the last index of each character
    max_length = 0
    start = 0

    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # If char is in dictionary and its index is greater than or equal to the start of current substring
        if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= start:
            start = char_index[char] + 1  # Move the start to the next index of the repeated character
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, i - start + 1)  # Update max_length if necessary

        char_index[char] = i  # Update the last index of the current character

    return max_length

# Test cases
test_cases = ["abcabcbb", "bbbbb", "pwwkew", ""]
for case in test_cases:
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {lengthOfLongestSubstring(case)}")
    print()

```

Explanation:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.
- Space Complexity: O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set. In the worst case, we need to store all characters in the dictionary.

This approach is the most efficient among the three, as it allows us to skip characters when we encounter a repeated character, rather than always moving the left pointer by one.

Recommendation:
I recommend learning and mastering the Sliding Window with Dictionary approach (Solution 3) for the following reasons:

1. It has the best time complexity (O(n)) among the three solutions.
2. It uses a common and versatile technique (sliding window) that can be applied to many other string and array problems.
3. It demonstrates efficient use of a hash table (dictionary) to optimize the solution.
4. It's relatively easy to understand and implement once you grasp the concept.

To help visualize this algorithm, let's create a simple React component that demonstrates how the sliding window moves through the string:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const SlidingWindowVisualization = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("abcabcbb");
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);
  const [windowStart, setWindowStart] = useState(0);
  const [charIndex, setCharIndex] = useState({});
  const [maxLength, setMaxLength] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (currentIndex < input.length) {
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        const char = input[currentIndex];
        if (char in charIndex && charIndex[char] >= windowStart) {
          setWindowStart(charIndex[char] + 1);
        } else {
          setMaxLength(Math.max(maxLength, currentIndex - windowStart + 1));
        }
        setCharIndex((prev) => ({ ...prev, [char]: currentIndex }));
        setCurrentIndex(currentIndex + 1);
      }, 1000);
      return () => clearTimeout(timer);
    }
  }, [currentIndex, input, windowStart, charIndex, maxLength]);

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <div className="mb-4">
        <input
          type="text"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => {
            setInput(e.target.value);
            setCurrentIndex(0);
            setWindowStart(0);
            setCharIndex({});
            setMaxLength(0);
          }}
          className="border p-2 rounded"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="font-mono text-2xl mb-4">
        {input.split("").map((char, index) => (
          <span
            key={index}
            className={`
              ${index === currentIndex ? "bg-yellow-300" : ""}
              ${index >= windowStart && index < currentIndex ? "bg-green-300" : ""}
              ${index < windowStart ? "text-gray-300" : ""}
            `}
          >
            {char}
          </span>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div>Current longest substring length: {maxLength}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SlidingWindowVisualization;
```

This visualization allows you to input a string and watch how the sliding window algorithm progresses through it. The current character being processed is highlighted in yellow, the current window is highlighted in green, and characters before the window start are grayed out.

To use this visualization:

1. The default input is "abcabcbb", but you can change it to any string you like.
2. Watch as the algorithm progresses through the string, updating the window and the longest substring length.
3. The visualization updates every second, allowing you to see each step of the process.

This visual representation should help reinforce your understanding of how the sliding window technique works for this problem.
