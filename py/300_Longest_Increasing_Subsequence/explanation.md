## Explanation: Longest Increasing Subsequence

### Analysis of problem & input data

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is a classic dynamic programming question that tests understanding of subsequence properties and optimization techniques. Key aspects to consider:

1. **Subsequence vs. Subarray**: A subsequence doesn't need to be contiguous, unlike a subarray. This allows for more flexibility in choosing elements.

2. **Strictly Increasing**: The subsequence must be strictly increasing, not allowing equal elements.

3. **Length of the array**: With `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`, we need to consider solutions that can handle relatively large inputs efficiently.

4. **Element range**: The elements can be both positive and negative, with a large range (`-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`). This means we can't use tricks based on non-negative integers.

5. **Optimization problem**: We're looking for the maximum length, not all possible subsequences.

The key principle that makes this question approachable is the optimal substructure property: the longest increasing subsequence ending at any index i can be formed by appending nums[i] to the longest increasing subsequence ending at some previous index j (where nums[j] < nums[i]), or by starting a new subsequence with nums[i] if no such j exists.

### Test cases

1. **Basic case**: `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]` (Output: 4)
2. **Decreasing sequence**: `[5,4,3,2,1]` (Output: 1)
3. **All equal elements**: `[7,7,7,7,7]` (Output: 1)
4. **Alternating sequence**: `[0,1,0,3,2,3]` (Output: 4)
5. **Single element**: `[42]` (Output: 1)
6. **Empty array**: `[]` (Output: 0)
7. **Long sequence with multiple LIS**: `[3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]` (Output: 5)

```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18],
    [5,4,3,2,1],
    [7,7,7,7,7],
    [0,1,0,3,2,3],
    [42],
    [],
    [3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
]

for i, case in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
    result = longest_increasing_subsequence(case)
    print(f"Test case {i}: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {result}\n")
```

1. Dynamic Programming (Bottom-up) [Neetcode solution]
2. Binary Search with Patience Sorting [Neetcode solution]
3. Recursive with Memoization (Top-down DP)

Count: 3 solutions (2 Neetcode solutions)

##### Rejected solutions

1. Brute Force (generate all subsequences)
2. Greedy Approach (doesn't work for this problem)

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Dynamic Programming (Bottom-up)

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0

        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n  # Initialize DP array with 1s

        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

        return max(dp)
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of nums

- We have two nested loops, both iterating up to n times

Space Complexity: O(n)

- We use an additional dp array of size n

- The dp array stores the length of the LIS ending at each index
- At each step, we consider all previous elements to see if we can extend their LIS
- The max value in dp at the end gives us the length of the overall LIS
- This approach builds solutions bottom-up, reusing solutions to smaller subproblems

##### Binary Search with Patience Sorting

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0

        tails = []
        for num in nums:
            if not tails or num > tails[-1]:
                tails.append(num)
            else:
                idx = bisect.bisect_left(tails, num)
                tails[idx] = num

        return len(tails)
```

Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of nums

- We iterate through the array once (O(n))
- For each element, we perform a binary search (O(log n))

Space Complexity: O(n)

- In the worst case, tails could be as large as nums

- This solution is based on the concept of Patience Sorting
- tails array maintains the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of lengths 1, 2, 3, ...
- Binary search is used to efficiently find the correct position to update in tails
- The length of tails at the end gives us the length of the LIS
- This approach is more efficient than the DP solution for large inputs

##### Recursive with Memoization (Top-down DP)

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        @functools.lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i: int, prev: int) -> int:
            if i == len(nums):
                return 0

            take = 0
            if nums[i] > prev:
                take = 1 + dfs(i + 1, nums[i])

            skip = dfs(i + 1, prev)

            return max(take, skip)

        return dfs(0, float('-inf'))
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of nums

- In the worst case, we explore all possible subsequences
- Memoization reduces redundant computations

Space Complexity: O(n^2)

- The memoization cache can store up to n \* n entries (for each combination of i and prev)

- This solution uses recursion with memoization (top-down DP)
- For each element, we have two choices: take it or skip it
- We only take an element if it's greater than the previous element in the sequence
- The memoization cache helps avoid redundant computations
- This approach can be more intuitive for some, showing the decision process explicitly

#### Rejected Approaches

1. **Brute Force**: Generating all subsequences and checking which is the longest increasing one. This would have a time complexity of O(2^n), which is far too slow for the given constraints.

2. **Greedy Approach**: A simple greedy approach of always picking the next larger number won't work. For example, in [3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5], a greedy approach would choose [3,4,5], missing the optimal solution [1,2,3,4,5].

#### Final Recommendations

For interviews, I recommend learning both the Dynamic Programming (Bottom-up) and the Binary Search with Patience Sorting approaches:

1. The DP solution is more intuitive and easier to explain, making it a good default choice in an interview setting.

2. The Binary Search solution is more efficient (O(n log n) vs O(n^2)) and demonstrates a higher level of algorithmic knowledge, which can be impressive in an interview.

Start with explaining the DP solution, then mention that there's a more efficient O(n log n) solution using binary search if time allows or if the interviewer asks for optimization.

### Visualization(s)

For the Dynamic Programming approach, we can visualize the dp array as it's being filled:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Table } from "@/components/ui/table";

const LISDPVisualization = () => {
  const [nums, setNums] = useState([10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]);
  const [dp, setDp] = useState([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]);

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">LIS DP Visualization</h3>
      <Table>
        <Table.Header>
          <Table.Row>
            <Table.Head>Index</Table.Head>
            {nums.map((_, i) => (
              <Table.Head key={i}>{i}</Table.Head>
            ))}
          </Table.Row>
        </Table.Header>
        <Table.Body>
          <Table.Row>
            <Table.Cell>nums</Table.Cell>
            {nums.map((num, i) => (
              <Table.Cell key={i}>{num}</Table.Cell>
            ))}
          </Table.Row>
          <Table.Row>
            <Table.Cell>dp</Table.Cell>
            {dp.map((val, i) => (
              <Table.Cell key={i}>{val}</Table.Cell>
            ))}
          </Table.Row>
        </Table.Body>
      </Table>
      <p className="mt-2">
        The dp array shows the length of the LIS ending at each index. The
        maximum value in dp (4) is the length of the overall LIS.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LISDPVisualization;
```

This visualization helps to understand how the dp array is filled and how it represents the length of the LIS ending at each index. The maximum value in the dp array (4 in this case) gives us the length of the overall LIS.
Certainly! I'll provide a more detailed explanation of the binary search with patience sorting approach, focusing on the `bisect.bisect_left` function and including an ASCII step-through of the algorithm.

## Explanation: Binary Search with Patience Sorting for LIS

### The `bisect.bisect_left` function

`bisect.bisect_left(a, x)` is a Python standard library function that performs a binary search on a sorted list `a`. It returns the leftmost insertion point for `x` in `a` to maintain sorted order. In other words:

1. If `x` is already present in `a`, it returns the index of the leftmost `x`.
2. If `x` is not present, it returns the index where `x` should be inserted to keep `a` sorted.

This function is crucial for our algorithm because it allows us to efficiently find where to insert or update elements in our `tails` list, maintaining its sorted property.

### Detailed algorithm explanation

1. We maintain a list `tails` where `tails[i]` is the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of length `i+1`.
2. For each number in the input:
   - If it's larger than all tails, append it (start a new pile).
   - Otherwise, use binary search to find the first tail that's greater than or equal to this number, and update that tail.
3. The length of `tails` at the end is the length of the LIS.

### ASCII step-through

Let's go through the algorithm step-by-step with the input `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`:

```
Initial state: tails = []

Step 1: num = 10
tails = [10]

Step 2: num = 9
tails = [9]  (replaced 10 with 9)

Step 3: num = 2
tails = [2]  (replaced 9 with 2)

Step 4: num = 5
tails = [2, 5]  (5 > 2, so we append)

Step 5: num = 3
tails = [2, 3]  (3 replaces 5)

Step 6: num = 7
tails = [2, 3, 7]  (7 > 3, so we append)

Step 7: num = 101
tails = [2, 3, 7, 101]  (101 > 7, so we append)

Step 8: num = 18
tails = [2, 3, 7, 18]  (18 replaces 101)

Final state: tails = [2, 3, 7, 18]
Length of LIS = len(tails) = 4
```

### Visualization of the process

To better understand how this algorithm works, let's visualize the state of the `tails` list after each step:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Table } from "@/components/ui/table";

const PatienceSortingVisualization = () => {
  const steps = [
    { num: 10, tails: [10] },
    { num: 9, tails: [9] },
    { num: 2, tails: [2] },
    { num: 5, tails: [2, 5] },
    { num: 3, tails: [2, 3] },
    { num: 7, tails: [2, 3, 7] },
    { num: 101, tails: [2, 3, 7, 101] },
    { num: 18, tails: [2, 3, 7, 18] },
  ];

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Patience Sorting Visualization</h3>
      <Table>
        <Table.Header>
          <Table.Row>
            <Table.Head>Step</Table.Head>
            <Table.Head>Current Number</Table.Head>
            <Table.Head>Tails After Step</Table.Head>
          </Table.Row>
        </Table.Header>
        <Table.Body>
          {steps.map((step, i) => (
            <Table.Row key={i}>
              <Table.Cell>{i + 1}</Table.Cell>
              <Table.Cell>{step.num}</Table.Cell>
              <Table.Cell>{JSON.stringify(step.tails)}</Table.Cell>
            </Table.Row>
          ))}
        </Table.Body>
      </Table>
      <p className="mt-2">
        The final length of the tails list (4) gives us the length of the LIS.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PatienceSortingVisualization;
```

This visualization shows how the `tails` list evolves as we process each number in the input array.

### Detailed explanation of key steps

1. When we encounter 10, it's the first element, so we add it to `tails`.
2. 9 is smaller than 10, so we replace 10 with 9 (using `bisect_left`).
3. 2 is smaller than 9, so we replace 9 with 2.
4. 5 is larger than 2, so we append it to `tails`.
5. 3 is between 2 and 5, so we replace 5 with 3 (using `bisect_left`).
6. 7 is larger than all elements in `tails`, so we append it.
7. 101 is larger than all elements in `tails`, so we append it.
8. 18 is between 7 and 101, so we replace 101 with 18 (using `bisect_left`).

The key insight is that at each step, `tails` represents the smallest possible values that can end an increasing subsequence of a given length. The length of `tails` at the end gives us the length of the LIS.

### Why this works

- If we can replace a larger tail with a smaller one, we're keeping the potential for longer subsequences open.
- The position where we do the replacement is crucial - it's always the leftmost position where the new number fits, which `bisect_left` gives us.
- This method doesn't construct the actual LIS, but it does give us its length, which is what the problem asks for.

This approach is particularly efficient because it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the insertion point, resulting in a time complexity of O(n log n), which is optimal for this problem.
