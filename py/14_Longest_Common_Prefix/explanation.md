## Explanation: Longest Common Prefix

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is about finding the longest common prefix among a set of strings. The key characteristics to note are:

1. We're dealing with an array of strings, which immediately suggests iterating through the array and comparing characters.
2. We're looking for a common prefix, which means we only need to focus on the beginning of each string.
3. The common prefix must be present in all strings, not just some of them.
4. The problem asks for the longest such prefix, implying we should continue checking characters until we find a mismatch.

The key principle that makes this question simple is the realization that the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string in the array. This gives us a natural bound for our search and helps in optimizing our approach.

Pattern-matching wise, this problem falls into the category of string manipulation and comparison. It's not a complex algorithmic problem, but rather one that tests your ability to efficiently iterate and compare strings.

### Test cases

Here are some relevant test cases to consider:

1. Normal case with a common prefix:
   Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
   Expected Output: "fl"

2. No common prefix:
   Input: ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
   Expected Output: ""

3. All strings are identical:
   Input: ["aa", "aa", "aa"]
   Expected Output: "aa"

4. Empty array:
   Input: []
   Expected Output: ""

5. Array with a single string:
   Input: ["alone"]
   Expected Output: "alone"

6. Strings with different lengths but common prefix:
   Input: ["c", "c++", "c#", "cpython"]
   Expected Output: "c"

7. Very long strings with a short common prefix:
   Input: ["interstellar", "introspection", "interstate", "interesting"]
   Expected Output: "int"

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def test_longest_common_prefix(func):
    test_cases = [
        (["flower", "flow", "flight"], "fl"),
        (["dog", "racecar", "car"], ""),
        (["aa", "aa", "aa"], "aa"),
        ([], ""),
        (["alone"], "alone"),
        (["c", "c++", "c#", "cpython"], "c"),
        (["interstellar", "introspection", "interstate", "interesting"], "int")
    ]

    for i, (input_strs, expected) in enumerate(test_cases):
        result = func(input_strs)
        print(f"Test case {i+1}: {'Passed' if result == expected else 'Failed'}")
        if result != expected:
            print(f"  Input: {input_strs}")
            print(f"  Expected: {expected}")
            print(f"  Got: {result}")
```

##### Rejected solutions

- Sorting the array of strings: While this might seem intuitive at first, it doesn't actually help solve the problem more efficiently and adds unnecessary complexity.
- Using a trie (prefix tree): While a trie is an excellent data structure for prefix-related problems, it's overkill for this specific problem and would be less efficient both in terms of time and space complexity.

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Vertical scanning

```python
from typing import List

def longestCommonPrefix(strs: List[str]) -> str:
    if not strs:
        return ""

    # Use the first string as a reference
    for i, char in enumerate(strs[0]):
        # Compare this character with the same position in all other strings
        for string in strs[1:]:
            # If we've reached the end of a string or found a mismatch
            if i == len(string) or string[i] != char:
                # Return the prefix up to this point
                return strs[0][:i]

    # If we've made it through the entire first string, it's the common prefix
    return strs[0]
```

Time Complexity: O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.
Space Complexity: O(1), we only use a constant amount of extra space.

- This approach scans the strings vertically, character by character.
- It uses the first string as a reference and compares each of its characters with the corresponding characters in other strings.
- The algorithm leverages the fact that the longest common prefix can't be longer than the shortest string in the array.
- It stops as soon as it finds a mismatch or reaches the end of a string, ensuring efficiency.

##### Horizontal scanning

```python
from typing import List

def longestCommonPrefix(strs: List[str]) -> str:
    if not strs:
        return ""

    prefix = strs[0]  # Start with the first string as the prefix
    for i in range(1, len(strs)):
        # Keep reducing the prefix until it's a prefix of the current string
        while strs[i].find(prefix) != 0:
            prefix = prefix[:-1]
            if not prefix:
                return ""

    return prefix
```

Time Complexity: O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.
Space Complexity: O(1), we only use a constant amount of extra space.

- This approach scans the strings horizontally.
- It starts with the entire first string as the potential prefix and then iteratively reduces it.
- The algorithm leverages the `find` method to check if the current prefix is at the start of each string.
- It's efficient for cases where strings have large common prefixes, as it can eliminate large chunks quickly.

##### Divide and conquer

```python
from typing import List

def longestCommonPrefix(strs: List[str]) -> str:
    if not strs:
        return ""

    def commonPrefix(left: str, right: str) -> str:
        min_length = min(len(left), len(right))
        for i in range(min_length):
            if left[i] != right[i]:
                return left[:i]
        return left[:min_length]

    def divideAndConquer(start: int, end: int) -> str:
        if start == end:
            return strs[start]

        mid = (start + end) // 2
        left_prefix = divideAndConquer(start, mid)
        right_prefix = divideAndConquer(mid + 1, end)

        return commonPrefix(left_prefix, right_prefix)

    return divideAndConquer(0, len(strs) - 1)
```

Time Complexity: O(S _log n), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings, and n is the number of strings.
Space Complexity: O(m_ log n) in the worst case, where m is the length of the longest string. This space is used on the recursion stack.

- This approach applies the divide and conquer paradigm to the problem.
- It recursively divides the array of strings into two halves, finds the common prefix for each half, and then combines the results.
- The algorithm leverages the fact that the longest common prefix of a set of strings is the longest common prefix of any two strings in the set.
- It's particularly efficient for large datasets as it can parallelize well.

##### Binary search on string length

```python
from typing import List

def longestCommonPrefix(strs: List[str]) -> str:
    if not strs:
        return ""

    def isCommonPrefix(length: int) -> bool:
        str1 = strs[0][:length]
        return all(s.startswith(str1) for s in strs[1:])

    min_length = min(len(s) for s in strs)
    low, high = 0, min_length

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if isCommonPrefix(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return strs[0][:high]
```

Time Complexity: O(S \* log m), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings, and m is the length of the shortest string.
Space Complexity: O(1), we only use a constant amount of extra space.

- This approach applies binary search on the length of the common prefix.
- It leverages the fact that if a prefix of length k is common, all prefixes of length less than k are also common.
- The algorithm efficiently narrows down the possible length of the longest common prefix.
- It's particularly effective when the strings are very long but have a relatively short common prefix.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Sorting the array of strings:
   While sorting might seem intuitive (thinking the common prefix would be between the first and last string lexicographically), it doesn't actually solve the problem more efficiently. Sorting would take O(n log n \* m) time (where n is the number of strings and m is the average string length), which is worse than our accepted solutions.

2. Using a trie (prefix tree):
   A trie is an excellent data structure for prefix-related problems, but for this specific problem, it's overkill. Building a trie would take O(S) time and space (where S is the sum of all characters), which is not better than our simpler solutions. Moreover, it adds unnecessary complexity to the solution.

#### Final Recommendations

For a coding interview setting, I would recommend learning and implementing the Vertical Scanning approach. Here's why:

1. It's simple to understand and implement, which reduces the chance of making mistakes under pressure.
2. It has optimal time complexity (O(S)) and constant space complexity.
3. It stops as soon as it finds a mismatch, making it efficient for cases where the common prefix is short.
4. The code is concise and easy to explain, which is valuable in an interview setting where clear communication is crucial.

The Horizontal Scanning approach is also worth knowing as an alternative, as it's similarly efficient and might be more intuitive for some people.

For more advanced interviews or discussions, understanding the Divide and Conquer and Binary Search approaches can demonstrate a deeper knowledge of algorithmic paradigms and problem-solving strategies.

### Visualization(s)

For this problem, a simple visualization can help understand the vertical scanning approach:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const LongestCommonPrefixVisualization = () => {
  const [strings, setStrings] = useState(["flower", "flow", "flight"]);
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);

  const commonPrefix = strings.reduce((prefix, str) => {
    while (str.indexOf(prefix) !== 0) {
      prefix = prefix.slice(0, -1);
    }
    return prefix;
  }, strings[0] || "");

  const handleNext = () => {
    setCurrentIndex((prev) => Math.min(prev + 1, commonPrefix.length));
  };

  const handlePrev = () => {
    setCurrentIndex((prev) => Math.max(prev - 1, 0));
  };

  const handleReset = () => {
    setCurrentIndex(0);
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4 max-w-lg mx-auto">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
        Longest Common Prefix Visualization
      </h2>
      <div className="mb-4">
        {strings.map((str, idx) => (
          <div key={idx} className="flex">
            {str.split("").map((char, charIdx) => (
              <span
                key={charIdx}
                className={`w-8 h-8 flex items-center justify-center border border-gray-300 ${
                  charIdx < currentIndex ? "bg-green-200" : ""
                } ${charIdx === currentIndex ? "bg-yellow-200" : ""}`}
              >
                {char}
              </span>
            ))}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <button
          onClick={handlePrev}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
          disabled={currentIndex === 0}
        >
          Previous
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={handleNext}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
          disabled={currentIndex === commonPrefix.length}
        >
          Next
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={handleReset}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-500 text-white rounded"
        >
          Reset
        </button>
      </div>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Current common prefix:{" "}
        <strong>{commonPrefix.slice(0, currentIndex)}</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LongestCommonPrefixVisualization;
```

This visualization demonstrates how the vertical scanning approach works by highlighting the characters being compared at each step. The green cells represent the current common prefix, while the yellow cell shows the character being compared. You can step through the process using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons, or reset the visualization with the "Reset" button.
