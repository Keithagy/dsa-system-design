## Explanation: Reorder List

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem involves manipulating a singly linked list to reorder its elements in a specific pattern. The key characteristics of this problem are:

1. We're dealing with a singly linked list, which means we can only traverse forward.
2. The reordering pattern interleaves elements from the start and end of the list.
3. We can't modify the values in the nodes, only the links between nodes.
4. The list length can vary from 1 to 50,000 nodes.

The core principle that simplifies this question is breaking it down into three distinct steps:

1. Find the middle of the list
2. Reverse the second half of the list
3. Merge the two halves alternately

This problem tests understanding of linked list operations, particularly reversing a linked list and merging two lists. It also checks the ability to break down a complex problem into simpler subproblems.

### Test cases

1. Single node: `[1]` → `[1]`
2. Two nodes: `[1,2]` → `[1,2]`
3. Odd number of nodes: `[1,2,3,4,5]` → `[1,5,2,4,3]`
4. Even number of nodes: `[1,2,3,4]` → `[1,4,2,3]`
5. Long list: `[1,2,3,...,9998,9999,10000]` → `[1,10000,2,9999,3,9998,...]`

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def create_linked_list(values):
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy
    for val in values:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return dummy.next

def linked_list_to_list(head):
    values = []
    while head:
        values.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return values

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [1],
    [1,2],
    [1,2,3,4,5],
    [1,2,3,4],
    list(range(1, 10001))
]

for case in test_cases:
    head = create_linked_list(case)
    # Assume solution function is named 'reorder_list'
    reorder_list(head)
    result = linked_list_to_list(head)
    print(f"Input: {case}")
    print(f"Output: {result}\n")
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Three-step approach (Neetcode solution)

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return

        # Step 1: Find the middle of the list
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
        second = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        prev = None
        while second:
            temp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = temp

        # Step 3: Merge the two halves
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first, second = temp1, temp2
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

- Finding the middle: O(n/2) ≈ O(n)
- Reversing the second half: O(n/2) ≈ O(n)
- Merging the two halves: O(n/2) ≈ O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Explanation:

- This solution leverages the fact that we can find the middle of a linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
- By reversing the second half of the list, we can easily interleave the nodes from the start and end.
- The merge step then combines the two halves in the required order.

Key intuitions:

- The slow pointer moves at half the speed of the fast pointer, so when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer is at the middle.
- Reversing a linked list in-place is a fundamental operation that allows us to traverse the second half in reverse order.
- By breaking the problem into these three steps, we can solve it using O(1) extra space.

##### Stack-based approach

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return

        # Step 1: Push all nodes to a stack
        stack = deque()
        curr = head
        while curr:
            stack.append(curr)
            curr = curr.next

        # Step 2: Reorder the list
        length = len(stack)
        curr = head
        for _ in range(length // 2):
            next_original = curr.next
            curr.next = stack.pop()
            curr.next.next = next_original
            curr = next_original

        # Set the new tail
        curr.next = None
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

- Pushing nodes to stack: O(n)
- Reordering the list: O(n/2) ≈ O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n), as we store all nodes in the stack.

Explanation:

- This solution uses a stack to reverse the order of the second half of the list.
- By pushing all nodes onto a stack, we can easily access them in reverse order.
- We then traverse the list again, inserting nodes from the stack between every pair of original nodes.

Key intuitions:

- A stack naturally reverses the order of elements, which is perfect for accessing the list nodes from end to start.
- By only processing half of the nodes in the reordering step, we achieve the correct interleaving of nodes from start and end.

##### Two-pointer approach with dummy nodes

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return

        # Step 1: Create two dummy nodes
        odd = dummy1 = ListNode(0)
        even = dummy2 = ListNode(0)

        # Step 2: Distribute nodes to odd and even lists
        curr = head
        while curr:
            odd.next = curr
            odd = odd.next
            curr = curr.next
            if curr:
                even.next = curr
                even = even.next
                curr = curr.next

        # Step 3: Reverse the even list
        prev, curr = None, dummy2.next
        while curr:
            next_node = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_node

        # Step 4: Merge the odd and reversed even lists
        odd, even = dummy1.next, prev
        while even:
            odd.next, odd = even, odd.next
            even.next, even = odd, even.next

        # Set the new tail
        odd.next = None
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

- Distributing nodes: O(n)
- Reversing even list: O(n/2) ≈ O(n)
- Merging lists: O(n/2) ≈ O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for dummy nodes and pointers.

Explanation:

- This solution separates the list into two lists: one with odd-indexed nodes and one with even-indexed nodes.
- The even-indexed list is then reversed.
- Finally, the two lists are merged alternately to achieve the desired order.

Key intuitions:

- By separating into odd and even lists, we naturally group the nodes that will be far apart in the final order.
- Reversing the even-indexed list allows us to access its nodes in reverse order during merging.
- Using dummy nodes simplifies the list manipulation process, especially at the beginning of each list.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Brute force with array conversion:

   - Convert the linked list to an array, reorder the array, then recreate the linked list.
   - Rejected because it uses O(n) extra space and doesn't leverage the linked list structure.

2. Recursive approach:
   - Recursively reach the end of the list, then on the way back up, insert nodes between the first half's nodes.
   - Rejected due to potential stack overflow for large lists and less intuitive implementation.

#### Final Recommendations

The three-step approach (Neetcode solution) is the best to learn for several reasons:

1. It's the most space-efficient, using only O(1) extra space.
2. It breaks down the problem into clear, understandable steps.
3. It utilizes fundamental linked list operations (finding middle, reversing, merging) that are valuable to know for other problems.
4. It's the most intuitive and easiest to explain in an interview setting.

While the stack-based and two-pointer approaches are valid, they either use more space or are more complex to implement and explain. The three-step approach strikes the best balance between efficiency, simplicity, and demonstrating linked list manipulation skills.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the three-step approach, we can use a simple ASCII representation:

```
Original list:   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

Step 1 (Find middle):
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> | 4 -> 5

Step 2 (Reverse second half):
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> | 5 -> 4

Step 3 (Merge):
1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
```

This visualization helps to understand how the list is transformed at each step of the algorithm.
