## Explanation: Rotate Image

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem requires rotating a square matrix (n x n) by 90 degrees clockwise. The key characteristics and constraints of this problem are:

1. The matrix is square (n x n), which simplifies our rotation logic.
2. We need to perform the rotation in-place, meaning we can't use additional data structures to store the rotated matrix.
3. The rotation is always 90 degrees clockwise.

The principle that makes this question simple is understanding that a 90-degree clockwise rotation can be achieved through a combination of simpler matrix operations:

1. Transposing the matrix (swapping elements across the main diagonal)
2. Reversing each row

This two-step process is the key insight that transforms a seemingly complex rotation into two straightforward operations. Understanding this pattern is crucial for solving this and similar matrix manipulation problems efficiently.

### Test cases

We should consider the following test cases:

1. A 1x1 matrix (edge case)
2. A 2x2 matrix (smallest non-trivial case)
3. A 3x3 matrix (odd-sized matrix)
4. A 4x4 matrix (even-sized matrix)
5. A matrix with negative numbers
6. A matrix with the maximum size (20x20)

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def test_rotate_image(rotate_function):
    test_cases = [
        [[1]],
        [[1,2],[3,4]],
        [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],
        [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]],
        [[-1,-2,-3],[-4,-5,-6],[-7,-8,-9]],
        [[i*20+j for j in range(20)] for i in range(20)]
    ]

    for i, matrix in enumerate(test_cases):
        original = [row[:] for row in matrix]  # Deep copy
        rotate_function(matrix)
        print(f"Test case {i+1}:")
        print("Original:", original)
        print("Rotated:", matrix)
        print()

# Usage:
# test_rotate_image(rotate)
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Transpose and Reverse

```python
def rotate(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
    n = len(matrix)

    # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            # Swap matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i]
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

    # Step 2: Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

- We traverse each element once during transposition (n^2 operations).
- We then reverse each row, which takes n operations for each of the n rows (another n^2 operations).
- Total: 2 \* O(n^2) = O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1), as we modify the matrix in-place without using any extra space.

Intuition and invariants:

- Transposing a matrix swaps elements across the main diagonal, effectively rotating them by 45 degrees.
- Reversing each row completes the 90-degree rotation.
- The combination of these two operations always results in a 90-degree clockwise rotation for any square matrix.

##### Four-way Swap

```python
def rotate(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n // 2 + n % 2):
        for j in range(n // 2):
            # Perform a 4-way swap
            temp = matrix[n - 1 - j][i]
            matrix[n - 1 - j][i] = matrix[n - 1 - i][n - j - 1]
            matrix[n - 1 - i][n - j - 1] = matrix[j][n - 1 -i]
            matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]
            matrix[i][j] = temp
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

- We iterate over approximately 1/4 of the matrix elements (n^2 / 4).
- For each element, we perform a constant number of operations (4-way swap).
- Total: O(n^2 / 4) = O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a single temporary variable regardless of the matrix size.

Intuition and invariants:

- We can rotate the matrix by swapping four elements at a time.
- Each group of four elements forms a cycle in the rotation.
- We only need to iterate over 1/4 of the matrix to rotate all elements.
- The indices for the four elements in each swap are related by the matrix size n.

##### Layer-by-Layer Rotation

```python
def rotate(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
    n = len(matrix)
    for layer in range(n // 2):
        first, last = layer, n - 1 - layer
        for i in range(first, last):
            # Save the top
            top = matrix[layer][i]

            # Left -> Top
            matrix[layer][i] = matrix[n - 1 - i][layer]

            # Bottom -> Left
            matrix[n - 1 - i][layer] = matrix[n - 1 - layer][n - 1 - i]

            # Right -> Bottom
            matrix[n - 1 - layer][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][n - 1 - layer]

            # Top -> Right
            matrix[i][n - 1 - layer] = top
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.

- We iterate over approximately n/2 layers.
- For each layer, we perform n operations.
- Total: O(n \* n/2) = O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a single temporary variable regardless of the matrix size.

Intuition and invariants:

- We can think of the matrix as concentric "layers" or "rings".
- Each layer can be rotated independently.
- We start from the outermost layer and move inwards.
- For each layer, we rotate the elements along its perimeter.
- The number of elements to rotate in each layer decreases as we move inwards.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Using additional space: While it would be simpler to create a new matrix and fill it with rotated values, this approach violates the problem's requirement to modify the matrix in-place. It would have O(n^2) space complexity, which is not optimal.

2. Rotating one element at a time: This approach, while correct, would be less efficient and more complex to implement. It would require tracking the position of each element as it moves through all four positions in its rotation cycle, leading to more complex code and potentially more errors.

#### Final Recommendations

The "Transpose and Reverse" method (Neetcode solution) is recommended as the best solution to learn for several reasons:

1. Simplicity: It's the easiest to understand and implement, consisting of two clear steps.
2. Efficiency: It has optimal time and space complexity.
3. Generalizability: The concept of combining matrix operations (transpose and reverse) to achieve rotation can be applied to other matrix problems.
4. Readability: The code is clean and easy to follow, which is important in interview settings.

While the other solutions are valid and demonstrate different problem-solving approaches, the "Transpose and Reverse" method strikes the best balance between simplicity, efficiency, and demonstrating understanding of matrix operations.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the "Transpose and Reverse" method, we can use a simple React component:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

const MatrixRotation = () => {
  const [matrix, setMatrix] = useState([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
  ]);
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);

  const transpose = () => {
    const n = matrix.length;
    const newMatrix = matrix.map((row) => [...row]);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
        [newMatrix[i][j], newMatrix[j][i]] = [newMatrix[j][i], newMatrix[i][j]];
      }
    }
    setMatrix(newMatrix);
    setStep(1);
  };

  const reverse = () => {
    setMatrix(matrix.map((row) => [...row].reverse()));
    setStep(2);
  };

  const reset = () => {
    setMatrix([
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9],
    ]);
    setStep(0);
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-2">
        {matrix.map((row, i) =>
          row.map((cell, j) => (
            <div
              key={`${i}-${j}`}
              className="w-12 h-12 flex items-center justify-center border border-gray-300"
            >
              {cell}
            </div>
          )),
        )}
      </div>
      <div className="space-x-2">
        <Button onClick={transpose} disabled={step !== 0}>
          Transpose
        </Button>
        <Button onClick={reverse} disabled={step !== 1}>
          Reverse Rows
        </Button>
        <Button onClick={reset} disabled={step === 0}>
          Reset
        </Button>
      </div>
      <div>
        {step === 0 && "Initial Matrix"}
        {step === 1 && "After Transpose"}
        {step === 2 && "After Row Reversal (Rotated)"}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MatrixRotation;
```
