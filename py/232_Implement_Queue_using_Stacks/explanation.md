## Explanation: Implement Queue using Stacks

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is a classic example of adapting one data structure (stack) to mimic the behavior of another (queue). The key characteristics to note are:

1. We are limited to using only two stacks.
2. We must implement FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior using LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structures.
3. The operations we need to implement are: push, pop, peek, and empty.
4. We are only allowed to use standard stack operations: push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty.

The central challenge here is that stacks naturally give us the opposite order of elements compared to queues. The key principle that makes this question simple is the realization that we can reverse the order of elements by transferring them between two stacks.

This problem tests understanding of:

1. The fundamental differences between stacks and queues.
2. How to creatively use basic data structures to implement more complex ones.
3. Amortized time complexity analysis.

### Test cases

We should consider the following test cases:

1. Basic functionality:

   - Push multiple elements
   - Pop an element
   - Peek at the front element
   - Check if empty on a non-empty queue
   - Check if empty on an empty queue

2. Edge cases:

   - Operations on an empty queue
   - Push and pop alternating operations

3. Performance test:
   - Large number of push operations followed by large number of pop operations

Here's a set of test cases in Python:

```python
def test_my_queue():
    # Test case 1: Basic functionality
    queue = MyQueue()
    queue.push(1)
    queue.push(2)
    queue.push(3)
    assert queue.peek() == 1, "Peek should return 1"
    assert queue.pop() == 1, "Pop should return 1"
    assert not queue.empty(), "Queue should not be empty"

    # Test case 2: Edge cases
    assert queue.pop() == 2, "Pop should return 2"
    assert queue.pop() == 3, "Pop should return 3"
    assert queue.empty(), "Queue should be empty"

    # Test case 3: Alternating push and pop
    queue.push(4)
    assert queue.pop() == 4, "Pop should return 4"
    queue.push(5)
    queue.push(6)
    assert queue.pop() == 5, "Pop should return 5"

    # Test case 4: Performance test
    for i in range(1000):
        queue.push(i)
    for i in range(1000):
        assert queue.pop() == i, f"Pop should return {i}"

    print("All test cases passed!")

# Run the tests
test_my_queue()
```

### Solutions

#### Overview of solution approaches

##### Solutions worth learning

1. Two-stack approach with lazy transfer (Amortized O(1) time complexity)
2. Two-stack approach with eager transfer (O(n) push, O(1) pop)

Count: 2 solutions

##### Rejected solutions

1. Using a single stack (not possible to achieve FIFO behavior)
2. Using a list or deque directly (violates the problem constraints)

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Two-stack approach with lazy transfer

```python
class MyQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = []  # For pushing elements
        self.stack2 = []  # For popping elements

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        # Always push to stack1
        self.stack1.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        # If stack2 is empty, transfer all elements from stack1
        if not self.stack2:
            self._transfer()
        return self.stack2.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        # If stack2 is empty, transfer all elements from stack1
        if not self.stack2:
            self._transfer()
        return self.stack2[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        # Queue is empty if both stacks are empty
        return len(self.stack1) == 0 and len(self.stack2) == 0

    def _transfer(self) -> None:
        # Transfer all elements from stack1 to stack2
        while self.stack1:
            self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
```

Time complexity:

- push: O(1)
- pop: Amortized O(1)
- peek: Amortized O(1)
- empty: O(1)

Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue

Intuitions and invariants:

- We use stack1 for pushing elements and stack2 for popping elements.
- Elements in stack2 are always in the correct order for popping (FIFO).
- We only transfer elements from stack1 to stack2 when stack2 is empty and we need to pop or peek.
- This lazy transfer approach ensures that each element is moved at most twice (once into stack1, once into stack2), leading to amortized O(1) time complexity for all operations.

##### Two-stack approach with eager transfer

```python
class MyQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = []  # Main stack
        self.stack2 = []  # Temporary stack for transfers

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        # Transfer all elements from stack1 to stack2
        while self.stack1:
            self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())

        # Push the new element to stack1
        self.stack1.append(x)

        # Transfer all elements back from stack2 to stack1
        while self.stack2:
            self.stack1.append(self.stack2.pop())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.stack1.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        return self.stack1[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.stack1) == 0
```

Time complexity:

- push: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue
- pop: O(1)
- peek: O(1)
- empty: O(1)

Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue

Intuitions and invariants:

- We maintain the queue order in stack1 at all times.
- When pushing a new element, we reverse the order of existing elements, add the new element, then reverse again.
- This approach makes pop and peek operations very simple and efficient.
- The trade-off is that push operations become more expensive.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Single stack approach: This is not possible because a single stack cannot maintain FIFO order without additional data structures or complex manipulations that would violate the problem constraints.

2. Using a list or deque directly: While this would be the simplest solution, it violates the problem constraint of using only stack operations. It's important to respect the constraints in interview questions, as they often test specific skills or concepts.

#### Final Recommendations

The two-stack approach with lazy transfer is the recommended solution to learn. It provides amortized O(1) time complexity for all operations, meeting the follow-up challenge. This solution demonstrates a deep understanding of how to use basic data structures creatively and efficiently. It also provides an excellent opportunity to discuss amortized analysis in an interview setting.

The eager transfer approach, while correct, is less efficient for push operations and doesn't meet the amortized O(1) time complexity goal. However, it's still worth understanding as it demonstrates an alternative thought process and trade-off in algorithm design.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the lazy transfer approach, we can use a simple ASCII art representation:

```
Initial state:
stack1: [1, 2, 3] (top)
stack2: []

After push(4):
stack1: [1, 2, 3, 4] (top)
stack2: []

After pop() (first transfer):
stack1: []
stack2: [1, 2, 3, 4] (top)

After pop() (return 1):
stack1: []
stack2: [2, 3, 4] (top)

After push(5):
stack1: [5] (top)
stack2: [2, 3, 4] (top)

After pop() (return 2):
stack1: [5] (top)
stack2: [3, 4] (top)
```

This visualization helps to understand how elements move between the two stacks and how the FIFO order is maintained despite using LIFO structures.

import React, { useState } from "react";

  const [input, setInput] = useState("");

  const push = () => {
    if (input) {
      setStack1([...stack1, input]);
      setInput("");
    }
  };

  const pop = () => {
    if (stack2.length === 0) {
      setStack2([...stack1.reverse()]);
      setStack1([]);
    }
    if (stack2.length > 0) {
      setStack2(stack2.slice(0, -1));
    }
  };

This React component provides an interactive visualization of the queue using stacks. Users can push elements onto the queue and pop elements from it, seeing how the elements move between the two stacks. This helps reinforce the concept of using two stacks to implement a queue.
