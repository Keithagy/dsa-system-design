# Detailed Explanation of Dynamic Programming (top-down with memoization) Solution

## Empty Tuple Symbolism

The empty tuple `()` represents a valid combination that sums to zero. It's the base case for our recursion. When we find a combination that exactly matches our target (i.e., when `target == 0`), we return this empty tuple. As we build up solutions, we'll prepend numbers to this tuple to create valid combinations.

## Recurrence Relation

The recurrence relation being used here is:

```python
dp(target, index) = dp(target, index + 1) +
                    [candidates[index] + comb for comb in dp(target - candidates[index], index)]
```

This relation expresses two choices at each step:

1. Don't use the current candidate: `dp(target, index + 1)`
2. Use the current candidate: Add the current candidate to all combinations that sum to `target - candidates[index]`

## Explanation of the Tuple Concatenation Line

Let's break down this line:

```python
result += tuple((candidates[index],) + comb for comb in with_current)
```

This line is indeed quite dense and deserves a more detailed explanation:

1. `with_current` contains all combinations that sum to `target - candidates[index]`
2. For each combination `comb` in `with_current`:
   - We create a new tuple: `(candidates[index],) + comb`
   - This prepends the current candidate to the existing combination
3. We use a generator expression to create these new tuples for all combinations in `with_current`
4. We convert this generator to a tuple with `tuple(...)`
5. We add (concatenate) this tuple of new combinations to our `result`

A more verbose and clear way to write this would be:

```python
new_combinations = []
for comb in with_current:
    new_comb = (candidates[index],) + comb
    new_combinations.append(new_comb)
result += tuple(new_combinations)
```

## Memoization in System Prompt

You're right to point this out. My system prompt specifically states: "For memoization, you must use a hash map directly in the algorithm, not use any kind of decorator." I made a mistake in using the `@lru_cache` decorator instead of implementing memoization manually with a hash map. I apologize for this oversight.

Here's how we could implement the memoization using a hash map, adhering to the system prompt:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def combinationSum(candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    candidates.sort()  # Sort candidates to ensure order
    memo = {}  # Hash map for memoization

    def dp(target: int, index: int) -> List[Tuple[int, ...]]:
        # Check if we've already computed this subproblem
        if (target, index) in memo:
            return memo[(target, index)]

        # Base cases:
        if target == 0:
            # Empty tuple symbolizes a valid combination that sums to zero
            # It's the starting point for building larger combinations
            return [()]
        if target < 0 or index == len(candidates):
            return []

        # Recurrence relation:
        # 1. Don't include the current candidate
        result = dp(target, index + 1)

        # 2. Include the current candidate
        with_current = dp(target - candidates[index], index)

        # Create new combinations by prepending the current candidate
        # to all combinations that sum to (target - candidates[index])
        new_combinations = []
        for comb in with_current:
            # Prepend current candidate to existing combination
            new_comb = (candidates[index],) + comb
            new_combinations.append(new_comb)

        # Add new combinations to the result
        result += tuple(new_combinations)

        # Memoize the result before returning
        memo[(target, index)] = result
        return result

    # Convert tuples back to lists for the final output
    return [list(comb) for comb in dp(target, 0)]
```

This implementation uses a dictionary `memo` to store the results of subproblems, keyed by the `(target, index)` pair. We check this dictionary at the start of each recursive call and store the result before returning.

I appreciate you pointing out these issues. It's crucial to provide clear, well-explained solutions, especially in an educational context, and to adhere to the given constraints. Your attention to detail helps improve the quality of the explanations.
