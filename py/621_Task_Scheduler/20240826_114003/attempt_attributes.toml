Your solution does not work because it does not enforce that less-frequent tasks are 
interleaved with more-frequent ones, which the efficient solution requires.
I do not understand the solution at all. Need to try again.

From neetcode:
- Key idea is that you prefer to do the most frequent operation first, so as to minimize the number of idle slots
- Use a queue to track if a given task has come off cooldown; if it has, you pop it from the queue and heappush it on so that you always process the most frequent task.
