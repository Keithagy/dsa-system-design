## Explanation: Trapping Rain Water

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is about calculating the amount of water that can be trapped between vertical bars of varying heights. The key characteristics and insights are:

1. The input is an array of non-negative integers representing the heights of bars.
2. Water can only be trapped between bars, not on the sides.
3. The amount of water trapped at any point depends on the minimum of the maximum heights to its left and right.
4. The problem can be seen as a variation of the "Two Pointers" pattern, where we need to consider information from both ends of the array.
5. It's also related to the concept of "monotonic stack", as we're interested in finding the next greater element in both directions.

The key principle that makes this question solvable is understanding that for each position, the water trapped is determined by the minimum of the maximum heights on both sides, minus the height at the current position. This insight allows us to transform a seemingly complex 2D problem into a 1D problem that can be solved efficiently.

### Test cases

1. Regular case: `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]` (Output: 6)
2. No water can be trapped: `[1,2,3,4,5]` (Output: 0)
3. Descending heights: `[5,4,3,2,1]` (Output: 0)
4. Single peak: `[0,1,0]` (Output: 0)
5. Two peaks: `[4,2,0,3,2,5]` (Output: 9)
6. Flat surface: `[2,2,2,2,2]` (Output: 0)
7. Empty array: `[]` (Output: 0)
8. Single element: `[5]` (Output: 0)

Here's the code to run these test cases:

```python
def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
    # Implementation goes here
    pass

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1],
    [1,2,3,4,5],
    [5,4,3,2,1],
    [0,1,0],
    [4,2,0,3,2,5],
    [2,2,2,2,2],
    [],
    [5]
]

for i, case in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
    print(f"Test case {i}: Input = {case}, Output = {trap(case)}")
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Two Pointers Approach (Neetcode solution)

```python
from typing import List

def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
    if not height:
        return 0

    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    left_max, right_max = height[left], height[right]
    water = 0

    while left < right:
        if left_max < right_max:
            left += 1
            left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
            water += left_max - height[left]
        else:
            right -= 1
            right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
            water += right_max - height[right]

    return water
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the height array. We traverse the array once with two pointers.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Intuition and invariants:

- We use two pointers, left and right, starting from the ends of the array.
- We maintain the maximum height seen from the left (left_max) and right (right_max).
- The key insight is that water can be trapped at a position if there are higher bars on both sides.
- We always move the pointer on the side with the lower max height because we know that this lower height is the limiting factor for trapping water.
- The difference between the current max height and the current bar height gives us the water trapped at that position.

##### Dynamic Programming Approach

```python
from typing import List

def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
    if not height:
        return 0

    n = len(height)
    left_max = [0] * n
    right_max = [0] * n

    # Fill left_max array
    left_max[0] = height[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], height[i])

    # Fill right_max array
    right_max[n-1] = height[n-1]
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        right_max[i] = max(right_max[i+1], height[i])

    # Calculate trapped water
    water = 0
    for i in range(n):
        water += min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]

    return water
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the height array. We do three passes through the array.
Space Complexity: O(n), as we use two additional arrays of size n.

Intuition and invariants:

- We precompute the maximum height to the left and right of each position.
- The water trapped at each position is the minimum of the left and right max heights minus the current height.
- This approach trades space for time, avoiding repeated computations.

##### Stack-based Approach

```python
from typing import List

def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
    stack = []
    water = 0

    for i, h in enumerate(height):
        while stack and h > height[stack[-1]]:
            top = stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                break
            distance = i - stack[-1] - 1
            bounded_height = min(h, height[stack[-1]]) - height[top]
            water += distance * bounded_height
        stack.append(i)

    return water
```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the height array. Each element is pushed and popped at most once.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, when the heights are in decreasing order.

Intuition and invariants:

- We use a stack to keep track of indices of bars.
- We push an index onto the stack when we see a bar shorter than the bar at the top of the stack.
- When we see a bar taller than the one at the top of the stack, we've found a potential "container" for water.
- We calculate the water in this container using the distance between the current bar and the one at the stack top, and the difference in heights.

##### Brute Force Approach

```python
from typing import List

def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
    water = 0
    for i in range(len(height)):
        left_max = max(height[:i+1])
        right_max = max(height[i:])
        water += min(left_max, right_max) - height[i]
    return water
```

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the height array. For each element, we're finding the maximum to its left and right.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Intuition and invariants:

- For each position, we find the maximum height to its left and right.
- The water trapped at each position is the minimum of these two heights minus the current height.
- This approach is intuitive but inefficient for large inputs.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Sorting-based approach: Sorting the array would destroy the original order of the bars, which is crucial for determining where water can be trapped. This approach is fundamentally flawed for this problem.

2. Divide and Conquer: While it's possible to solve this problem using a divide and conquer approach (splitting the array, solving for each half, and then combining), it's more complex and less efficient than the other approaches we've discussed. It would likely have a time complexity of O(n log n) and require additional space for recursion.

#### Final Recommendations

The Two Pointers approach (Neetcode solution) is the best to learn for this problem. It's the most efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, and it demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem. This approach is also applicable to other problems involving array traversal from both ends.

The Dynamic Programming and Stack-based approaches are also worth understanding as they demonstrate different problem-solving paradigms and can be more intuitive for some people.

The Brute Force approach, while not efficient, is good for understanding the basic concept of the problem and can be a stepping stone to more optimized solutions.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the Two Pointers approach, we can use a simple ASCII art representation:

```
Height: [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Initial state:
L                                 R
0  1  0  2  1  0  1  3  2  1  2  1
LM:0                           RM:1

After some iterations:
      L              R
0  1  0  2  1  0  1  3  2  1  2  1
LM:2              RM:3

Final state:
            LR
0  1  0  2  1  0  1  3  2  1  2  1
LM:3           RM:3

Water trapped: 6
```

This visualization shows how the left (L) and right (R) pointers move towards each other, maintaining the left_max (LM) and right_max (RM) values. The water is calculated at each step based on these values.
