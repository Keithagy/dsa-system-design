## Explanation: Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is fundamentally about encoding and decoding a binary tree structure into a string format. The key aspects to consider are:

1. Tree Structure: We need to capture the structure of the tree, including null nodes, to ensure accurate reconstruction.
2. Node Values: We must preserve the values of each node in the serialized string.
3. Order of Traversal: The choice of traversal order (e.g., pre-order, level-order) affects how we encode and decode the tree.
4. Delimiter: We need a way to separate node values in the serialized string.
5. Null Representation: How we represent null nodes is crucial for accurate deserialization.

The input data is a binary tree with the following characteristics:

- It can have up to 10^4 nodes, so our solution needs to be efficient.
- Node values range from -1000 to 1000, so we don't need to worry about very large integers.
- The tree can be empty, which is a crucial edge case to handle.

The key principle that makes this question manageable is the recursive nature of binary trees. By choosing an appropriate traversal method (like pre-order or level-order), we can systematically encode the tree structure and values into a string, and then use the same order to reconstruct the tree during deserialization.

### Test cases

1. Normal case: A balanced binary tree

   ```python
   root = TreeNode(1)
   root.left = TreeNode(2)
   root.right = TreeNode(3)
   root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
   root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
   ```

2. Edge case: Empty tree

   ```python
   root = None
   ```

3. Edge case: Tree with only one node

   ```python
   root = TreeNode(1)
   ```

4. Unbalanced tree: Skewed to the left

   ```python
   root = TreeNode(1)
   root.left = TreeNode(2)
   root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
   root.left.left.left = TreeNode(4)
   ```

5. Tree with negative values and null nodes
   ```python
   root = TreeNode(-10)
   root.left = TreeNode(9)
   root.right = TreeNode(20)
   root.right.left = TreeNode(15)
   root.right.right = TreeNode(-7)
   ```

Here's the executable code for these test cases:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def create_test_cases():
    # Test case 1: Normal case
    t1 = TreeNode(1)
    t1.left = TreeNode(2)
    t1.right = TreeNode(3)
    t1.left.left = TreeNode(4)
    t1.left.right = TreeNode(5)

    # Test case 2: Empty tree
    t2 = None

    # Test case 3: Tree with only one node
    t3 = TreeNode(1)

    # Test case 4: Unbalanced tree
    t4 = TreeNode(1)
    t4.left = TreeNode(2)
    t4.left.left = TreeNode(3)
    t4.left.left.left = TreeNode(4)

    # Test case 5: Tree with negative values and null nodes
    t5 = TreeNode(-10)
    t5.left = TreeNode(9)
    t5.right = TreeNode(20)
    t5.right.left = TreeNode(15)
    t5.right.right = TreeNode(-7)

    return [t1, t2, t3, t4, t5]

test_cases = create_test_cases()
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Pre-order DFS with string serialization (Neetcode solution)

```python
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.

        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return "null,"
            return str(node.val) + "," + dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right)

        return dfs(root)


    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.

        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        def dfs():
            val = next(values)
            if val == "null":
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(val))
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
            return node

        values = iter(data.split(","))
        return dfs()
```

Time Complexity: O(n) for both serialization and deserialization, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

- Serialization: We visit each node once in the pre-order traversal.
- Deserialization: We process each value in the string once, creating nodes as we go.

Space Complexity: O(n) for both operations.

- Serialization: The output string will be proportional to the number of nodes.
- Deserialization: In the worst case (a skewed tree), the recursion stack can go up to the height of the tree, which could be n in a completely unbalanced tree.

Key intuitions and invariants:

- Pre-order traversal (root, left, right) allows us to reconstruct the tree easily.
- "null" is used to represent null nodes, which is crucial for accurate reconstruction.
- The comma delimiter allows easy splitting of the string during deserialization.
- The use of an iterator in deserialization allows for efficient, in-place processing of the input string.

##### Level-order BFS with string serialization

```python
from collections import deque

class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.

        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not root:
            return "[]"

        queue = deque([root])
        result = []
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node:
                result.append(str(node.val))
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
            else:
                result.append("null")

        # Remove trailing nulls
        while result[-1] == "null":
            result.pop()

        return "[" + ",".join(result) + "]"


    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.

        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if data == "[]":
            return None

        nodes = [None if val == "null" else TreeNode(int(val))
                 for val in data[1:-1].split(",")]

        kids = nodes[::-1]
        root = kids.pop()
        for node in nodes:
            if node:
                if kids: node.left  = kids.pop()
                if kids: node.right = kids.pop()
        return root
```

Time Complexity: O(n) for both serialization and deserialization.

- Serialization: We visit each node once in the level-order traversal.
- Deserialization: We process each value in the string once, creating nodes as we go.

Space Complexity: O(n) for both operations.

- Serialization: The queue can contain at most all leaf nodes, which is approximately n/2 in a full binary tree.
- Deserialization: We create a list of all nodes, which is O(n).

Key intuitions and invariants:

- Level-order traversal captures the tree structure in a way that's easy to reconstruct.
- Null nodes are included in the serialization to preserve structure information.
- The use of a queue in serialization ensures we visit nodes in level order.
- In deserialization, we can rebuild the tree by assigning left and right children in reverse order.

##### Pre-order DFS with list serialization

```python
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.

        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                result.append("null")
                return
            result.append(str(node.val))
            dfs(node.left)
            dfs(node.right)

        result = []
        dfs(root)
        return ",".join(result)


    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.

        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        def dfs():
            if not values:
                return None
            val = values.pop(0)
            if val == "null":
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(val))
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
            return node

        values = data.split(",")
        return dfs()
```

Time Complexity: O(n) for both serialization and deserialization.

- Serialization: We visit each node once in the pre-order traversal.
- Deserialization: We process each value in the list once, creating nodes as we go.

Space Complexity: O(n) for both operations.

- Serialization: We create a list containing all node values and nulls, which is O(n).
- Deserialization: In the worst case (a skewed tree), the recursion stack can go up to the height of the tree, which could be n in a completely unbalanced tree.

Key intuitions and invariants:

- Pre-order traversal allows for straightforward reconstruction of the tree.
- Using a list instead of a string can be more efficient for certain operations.
- The use of "null" to represent null nodes ensures accurate tree structure preservation.
- In deserialization, we can rebuild the tree by recursively constructing left and right subtrees.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. In-order traversal: While this approach works well for binary search trees, it doesn't preserve enough information to reconstruct a general binary tree. For example, the trees `[1,2,3]` and `[2,1,3]` would have the same in-order traversal `[2,1,3]`, making it impossible to distinguish between them during deserialization.

2. Post-order traversal: Although it's possible to serialize and deserialize a binary tree using post-order traversal, it's less intuitive and harder to implement than pre-order traversal. The main difficulty lies in determining the root of the tree during deserialization, as it comes last in the traversal order.

3. JSON serialization: While it's possible to serialize a binary tree as a JSON object, this approach doesn't demonstrate a deep understanding of tree structures and traversals. It relies on built-in JSON parsing, which masks the underlying algorithmic complexity and doesn't showcase skills relevant to a coding interview.

4. Bracket notation: A solution using nested brackets (e.g., `"(1(2)(3))"`) could work but is more prone to parsing errors and doesn't handle null nodes as elegantly as the comma-separated approach.

#### Final Recommendations

The pre-order DFS with string serialization (Neetcode solution) is recommended as the best solution to learn. Here's why:

1. Intuitive: Pre-order traversal (root, left, right) naturally maps to how we typically think about and construct binary trees.
2. Efficient: It has O(n) time and space complexity for both serialization and deserialization.
3. Compact: The serialized string is concise and easy to understand.
4. Flexible: It handles all types of binary trees, including empty trees and trees with null nodes.
5. Interview-friendly: It's easy to explain and implement in a time-constrained interview setting.

While the level-order BFS approach is also valid and has some advantages (like being able to visualize the tree level by level), it's slightly more complex to implement and might be overkill for this specific problem.

The list-based approach, while similar to the string-based one, doesn't offer significant advantages and may be less efficient in terms of memory usage when dealing with very large trees.

### Visualization(s)

For this problem, a visualization of the serialization process for a simple binary tree would be helpful. Here's an ASCII representation:

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   / \
  4   5 6   7

Serialization steps (pre-order):
1 -> 1,
2 -> 1,2,
4 -> 1,2,4,
null -> 1,2,4,null,
null -> 1,2,4,null,null,
5 -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,
null -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,
null -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,
3 -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,3,
6 -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,3,6,
null -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,3,6,null,
null -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,3,6,null,null,
7 -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,3,6,null,null,7,
null -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,3,6,null,null,7,null,
null -> 1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,3,6,null,null,7,null,null

Final serialized string:
1,2,4,null,null,5,null,null,3,6,null,null,7,null,null
```

This visualization demonstrates how the pre-order traversal captures the structure of the tree, including null nodes, in a way that allows for straightforward deserialization.
