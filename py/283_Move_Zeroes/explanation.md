Certainly! I'll provide a few different solutions to the "Move Zeroes" problem, explain their complexities, and recommend the best one to learn. Let's start with the solutions and then move on to the visualization and test cases.

Solution 1: Two-pointer approach

```python
from typing import List

def move_zeroes(nums: List[int]) -> None:
    """
    Moves all zeroes to the end of the array in-place.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): The input array of integers.

    Returns:
    None: The function modifies the input array in-place.
    """
    # Initialize the position where we'll place non-zero elements
    non_zero_pos = 0

    # Iterate through the array
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            # Swap the current non-zero element with the element at non_zero_pos
            nums[i], nums[non_zero_pos] = nums[non_zero_pos], nums[i]
            non_zero_pos += 1

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [0, 1, 0, 3, 12],
    [0],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
]

for case in test_cases:
    original = case.copy()
    move_zeroes(case)
    print(f"Input: {original}")
    print(f"Output: {case}")
    print()

```

Explanation:

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we're modifying the array in-place and only using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution uses two pointers: one to iterate through the array and another to keep track of where to place non-zero elements. It effectively partitions the array into two sections: non-zero elements and zeroes.

Solution 2: Count non-zero elements

```python
from typing import List

def move_zeroes(nums: List[int]) -> None:
    """
    Moves all zeroes to the end of the array in-place.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): The input array of integers.

    Returns:
    None: The function modifies the input array in-place.
    """
    # Count and place non-zero elements
    non_zero_count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num != 0:
            nums[non_zero_count] = num
            non_zero_count += 1

    # Fill the rest with zeroes
    for i in range(non_zero_count, len(nums)):
        nums[i] = 0

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [0, 1, 0, 3, 12],
    [0],
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 2],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
]

for case in test_cases:
    original = case.copy()
    move_zeroes(case)
    print(f"Input: {original}")
    print(f"Output: {case}")
    print()

```

Explanation:

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array twice.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we're modifying the array in-place and only using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution first counts and places all non-zero elements at the beginning of the array, then fills the rest with zeroes.

Recommendation:
I recommend learning the two-pointer approach (Solution 1) for the following reasons:

1. It requires only one pass through the array, which is slightly more efficient.
2. It's more intuitive and easier to understand conceptually.
3. The two-pointer technique is widely applicable to many other array manipulation problems.

Visualization:
To help visualize the two-pointer approach, let's create a simple React component that demonstrates the algorithm step by step.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const MoveZeroesVisualization = () => {
  const [array, setArray] = useState([0, 1, 0, 3, 12]);
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
  const [nonZeroPos, setNonZeroPos] = useState(0);
  const [currentPos, setCurrentPos] = useState(0);

  const reset = () => {
    setArray([0, 1, 0, 3, 12]);
    setStep(0);
    setNonZeroPos(0);
    setCurrentPos(0);
  };

  const nextStep = () => {
    if (step >= array.length) return;

    const newArray = [...array];
    if (newArray[currentPos] !== 0) {
      [newArray[currentPos], newArray[nonZeroPos]] = [
        newArray[nonZeroPos],
        newArray[currentPos],
      ];
      setNonZeroPos(nonZeroPos + 1);
    }
    setArray(newArray);
    setCurrentPos(currentPos + 1);
    setStep(step + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4 max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Move Zeroes Visualization</h2>
      <div className="flex justify-center mb-4">
        {array.map((num, index) => (
          <div
            key={index}
            className={`w-10 h-10 border border-gray-300 flex items-center justify-center m-1 ${
              index === nonZeroPos
                ? "bg-blue-200"
                : index === currentPos
                  ? "bg-green-200"
                  : ""
            }`}
          >
            {num}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between mb-4">
        <button
          onClick={nextStep}
          className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
          disabled={step >= array.length}
        >
          Next Step
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={reset}
          className="bg-gray-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
        >
          Reset
        </button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Step: {step}</p>
        <p>Non-zero position: {nonZeroPos}</p>
        <p>Current position: {currentPos}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MoveZeroesVisualization;
```

This visualization shows the array at each step of the algorithm. The blue cell represents the `non_zero_pos` pointer, and the green cell represents the current position we're examining. You can step through the algorithm to see how it moves the non-zero elements to the front of the array.

Test Cases:
We've included test cases in both solution implementations. These test cases cover various scenarios:

1. Standard case with multiple zeroes: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
2. Edge case with a single zero: [0]
3. Case with no zeroes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
4. Case with zeroes at the beginning: [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]
5. Alternating zeroes and non-zeroes: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

These test cases help ensure that the algorithm works correctly for different input patterns.

In conclusion, the two-pointer approach (Solution 1) is recommended for its efficiency and wide applicability. The visualization provided helps in understanding how the algorithm works step by step. The test cases ensure that the solution works for various input scenarios.
