Explanation of the XOR approach:

- XOR (exclusive or) operation has the following properties:
  1. a ^ 0 = a
  2. a ^ a = 0
  3. a ^ b ^ a = (a ^ a) ^ b = 0 ^ b = b
- By XORing all numbers in the array, the duplicate numbers will cancel out (property 2), and we'll be left with the single number (property 3).
