## Explanation: Minimum Knight Moves

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is a classic shortest path problem on an infinite 2D grid with a specific movement pattern. The key characteristics of this problem are:

1. Infinite chess board: The grid extends infinitely in all directions.
2. Knight's move: The knight can move in 8 possible directions, each move being two squares in a cardinal direction followed by one square orthogonally.
3. Start position: The knight always starts at [0, 0].
4. Goal: Find the minimum number of moves to reach a target square [x, y].
5. Guaranteed solution: The problem states that an answer always exists.

The core principle that makes this question tractable is the symmetry of the chessboard and the knight's moves. Due to this symmetry, we can reduce the problem to finding the shortest path in only one quadrant of the plane, specifically the first quadrant (where both x and y are non-negative).

This problem is essentially a graph traversal problem, where each square on the chessboard is a node, and the knight's possible moves are the edges connecting these nodes. The optimal solution typically involves using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, as BFS always finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph (where each move has the same cost).

### Test cases

1. Edge cases:

   - Target at [0, 0]: Should return 0 moves
   - Target at [1, 1]: Should return 2 moves (can't be reached in 1 move)
   - Targets at maximum distance: [-300, -300], [300, 300], [-300, 300], [300, -300]

2. Symmetry cases:

   - [2, 1] and [-2, -1] should return the same result
   - [5, 5] and [-5, -5] should return the same result

3. Various distances:
   - Short distance: [2, 1]
   - Medium distance: [5, 5]
   - Longer distance: [100, 100]

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def minKnightMoves(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    # Implementation goes here
    pass

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (0, 0),  # Edge case: Start position
    (1, 1),  # Edge case: Closest unreachable in 1 move
    (2, 1),  # Example 1
    (5, 5),  # Example 2
    (-2, -1),  # Symmetry check with (2, 1)
    (-5, -5),  # Symmetry check with (5, 5)
    (300, 300),  # Max distance
    (-300, -300),  # Max distance, different quadrant
    (100, 100),  # Longer distance
]

for x, y in test_cases:
    result = minKnightMoves(x, y)
    print(f"Minimum moves to reach ({x}, {y}): {result}")
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Breadth-First Search (BFS) with symmetry optimization

```python
from collections import deque

def minKnightMoves(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    # Use absolute values due to symmetry
    x, y = abs(x), abs(y)

    # Define possible moves
    moves = [
        (2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2), (-2, 1),
        (-2, -1), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (2, -1)
    ]

    # Initialize queue and visited set
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # (x, y, moves)
    visited = set([(0, 0)])

    while queue:
        curr_x, curr_y, steps = queue.popleft()

        # Check if we've reached the target
        if curr_x == x and curr_y == y:
            return steps

        # Explore all possible moves
        for dx, dy in moves:
            next_x, next_y = curr_x + dx, curr_y + dy

            # Optimization: stay in the first quadrant (plus a small buffer)
            if next_x >= -1 and next_y >= -1 and (next_x, next_y) not in visited:
                visited.add((next_x, next_y))
                queue.append((next_x, next_y, steps + 1))

    return -1  # This should never be reached given the problem constraints
```

Time Complexity: O(max(|x|, |y|)^2)

- In the worst case, we might need to explore all squares within a diamond shape around the origin, bounded by the target coordinates.
- The area of this diamond is proportional to the square of the maximum of |x| and |y|.

Space Complexity: O(max(|x|, |y|)^2)

- We store visited squares in a set, which in the worst case could include all squares we explore.

Intuitions and invariants:

- BFS guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- The symmetry of the chessboard allows us to consider only the first quadrant (plus a small buffer into the negative coordinates).
- We use a queue to maintain the frontier of exploration, ensuring we explore all positions at a given distance before moving further.
- The visited set prevents revisiting squares, crucial for avoiding infinite loops on an infinite board.

##### Bidirectional BFS

```python
from collections import deque

def minKnightMoves(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    def get_neighbors(x: int, y: int) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:
        moves = [
            (2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2), (-2, 1),
            (-2, -1), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (2, -1)
        ]
        return [(x + dx, y + dy) for dx, dy in moves]

    # Use absolute values due to symmetry
    x, y = abs(x), abs(y)

    # Initialize forward and backward queues and visited sets
    forward_queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # (x, y, steps)
    backward_queue = deque([(x, y, 0)])
    forward_visited = {(0, 0): 0}
    backward_visited = {(x, y): 0}

    while forward_queue and backward_queue:
        # Expand forward
        fx, fy, f_steps = forward_queue.popleft()
        for nx, ny in get_neighbors(fx, fy):
            if (nx, ny) in backward_visited:
                return f_steps + 1 + backward_visited[(nx, ny)]
            if (nx, ny) not in forward_visited and nx >= -1 and ny >= -1:
                forward_visited[(nx, ny)] = f_steps + 1
                forward_queue.append((nx, ny, f_steps + 1))

        # Expand backward
        bx, by, b_steps = backward_queue.popleft()
        for nx, ny in get_neighbors(bx, by):
            if (nx, ny) in forward_visited:
                return b_steps + 1 + forward_visited[(nx, ny)]
            if (nx, ny) not in backward_visited and nx >= -1 and ny >= -1:
                backward_visited[(nx, ny)] = b_steps + 1
                backward_queue.append((nx, ny, b_steps + 1))

    return -1  # This should never be reached given the problem constraints
```

Time Complexity: O(max(|x|, |y|))

- Bidirectional BFS can potentially reduce the search space significantly.
- In the best case, each search only needs to explore about half the distance, leading to a linear time complexity in terms of the target coordinates.

Space Complexity: O(max(|x|, |y|))

- We maintain two separate visited sets, but the total space used is still proportional to the distance to the target.

Intuitions and invariants:

- Bidirectional search explores from both the start and end points simultaneously.
- The search terminates when the two frontiers meet, potentially exploring far fewer nodes than a unidirectional search.
- We still leverage the symmetry of the chessboard to restrict our search mostly to the first quadrant.
- The algorithm maintains the invariant that the sum of steps from both directions gives the total path length.

##### A\* Search

```python
import heapq

def minKnightMoves(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    def heuristic(x: int, y: int, target_x: int, target_y: int) -> int:
        # Admissible heuristic: minimum of Manhattan distance divided by 3 and Chebyshev distance
        return max(abs(x - target_x), abs(y - target_y)) // 3

    # Use absolute values due to symmetry
    x, y = abs(x), abs(y)

    moves = [
        (2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2), (-2, 1),
        (-2, -1), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (2, -1)
    ]

    # Initialize priority queue and visited set
    pq = [(0, 0, 0, 0)]  # (f_score, g_score, x, y)
    visited = set()

    while pq:
        f, g, curr_x, curr_y = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if curr_x == x and curr_y == y:
            return g

        if (curr_x, curr_y) in visited:
            continue

        visited.add((curr_x, curr_y))

        for dx, dy in moves:
            next_x, next_y = curr_x + dx, curr_y + dy
            if next_x >= -1 and next_y >= -1:
                next_g = g + 1
                next_h = heuristic(next_x, next_y, x, y)
                next_f = next_g + next_h
                heapq.heappush(pq, (next_f, next_g, next_x, next_y))

    return -1  # This should never be reached given the problem constraints
```

Time Complexity: O(max(|x|, |y|)^2)

- In the worst case, A\* might explore a similar number of nodes as BFS.
- However, with a good heuristic, A\* often performs better in practice, especially for larger distances.

Space Complexity: O(max(|x|, |y|)^2)

- We store visited nodes and maintain a priority queue, which in the worst case could include all explored nodes.

Intuitions and invariants:

- A\* uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal more efficiently than BFS.
- The heuristic function must be admissible (never overestimate the cost) to guarantee optimality.
- We use a combination of Manhattan distance and Chebyshev distance as our heuristic, divided by 3 to account for the knight's movement.
- The algorithm maintains the invariant that f_score = g_score + h_score, where g_score is the known cost to reach a node, and h_score is the estimated cost to the goal.

##### Mathematical approach

```python
def minKnightMoves(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    # Use absolute values due to symmetry
    x, y = abs(x), abs(y)

    # Handle special cases
    if x + y == 0:
        return 0
    elif x + y == 1:
        return 3
    elif x == 2 and y == 2:
        return 4

    # Calculate the minimum number of moves
    moves = max((max(x, y) + 1) // 2, (x + y + 2) // 3)

    # Adjust for parity
    if moves % 2 != (x + y) % 2:
        moves += 1

    return moves
```

Time Complexity: O(1)

- This solution performs a constant number of arithmetic operations regardless of input size.

Space Complexity: O(1)

- We only use a constant amount of additional space.

Intuitions and invariants:

- The knight's movement follows certain patterns that can be mathematically derived.
- The minimum number of moves is related to the maximum of x and y coordinates, and their sum.
- We need to handle special cases for very close positions separately.
- The parity (oddness/evenness) of the sum of coordinates must match the parity of the number of moves.
- This solution leverages deep mathematical insights about the knight's tour problem and may not be immediately intuitive.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Depth-First Search (DFS):

   - While DFS can find a path, it doesn't guarantee the shortest path without exploring the entire space.
   - In an infinite grid, DFS could potentially go off in the wrong direction indefinitely.

2. Dijkstra's algorithm:

   - Dijkstra's algorithm is designed for weighted graphs. In this problem, all moves have the same weight (1).
   - Using Dijkstra's would add unnecessary complexity without providing any benefit over BFS.

3. Dynamic Programming:
   - While it's possible to use DP, it's less intuitive and potentially less efficient for this specific problem.
   - DP would require maintaining a large 2D array, which could be memory-intensive for large coordinates.
   - The recursive nature of knight moves doesn't lend itself as naturally to a bottom-up DP approach as it does to BFS.

#### Final Recommendations

For a technical coding interview setting, I recommend learning and implementing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) with symmetry optimization approach. Here's why:

1. It's intuitive and easy to explain, which is crucial in an interview setting.
2. It demonstrates understanding of graph traversal algorithms, a fundamental concept in computer science.
3. The symmetry optimization shows problem-solving skills and the ability to optimize based on problem characteristics.
4. It has a reasonable time and space complexity for the given constraints.
5. The implementation is relatively straightforward and less prone to bugs compared to more complex approaches like A\* or bidirectional BFS.

While the mathematical approach is the most efficient, it requires deep insights that might be hard to derive during an interview. The A\* and bidirectional BFS approaches are also excellent solutions but might be overkill for this specific problem and could be more challenging to implement correctly under interview pressure.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the BFS approach, we can use a simple ASCII representation of the chessboard:

```
   y
   ^
 2 |  .  .  G
 1 |  .  .  .
 0 |  S  .  .
-1 |  .  .  .
   +------------> x
    -1  0  1  2

S: Start (0, 0)
G: Goal (2, 1)
.: Explored positions

BFS exploration:
Step 1: (0, 0)
Step 2: (-1, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, -1), (1, -2), (-1, -2), (-2, -1), (-2, 1)
Goal reached at (2, 1) in 1 move.
```

This visualization helps to understand how BFS explores positions in "waves" moving outward from the starting point, guaranteeing the shortest path.
