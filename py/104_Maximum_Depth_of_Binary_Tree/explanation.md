Certainly! Let's explore different solutions to the "Maximum Depth of Binary Tree" problem, analyze their complexity, and provide visualizations where helpful. We'll start with the most straightforward solution and then explore more optimized approaches.

Solution 1: Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)

This is the most intuitive and commonly used solution for this problem.

```python
from typing import Optional

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        # Base case: if the node is None, return 0
        if not root:
            return 0

        # Recursively calculate the depth of left and right subtrees
        left_depth = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        right_depth = self.maxDepth(root.right)

        # Return the maximum of left and right depths, plus 1 for the current node
        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

# Test cases
def test_max_depth():
    # Test case 1: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    root1 = TreeNode(3)
    root1.left = TreeNode(9)
    root1.right = TreeNode(20)
    root1.right.left = TreeNode(15)
    root1.right.right = TreeNode(7)

    # Test case 2: [1,null,2]
    root2 = TreeNode(1)
    root2.right = TreeNode(2)

    solution = Solution()
    assert solution.maxDepth(root1) == 3, "Test case 1 failed"
    assert solution.maxDepth(root2) == 2, "Test case 2 failed"
    print("All test cases passed!")

test_max_depth()

```

Explanation:

1. We define a `TreeNode` class to represent nodes in the binary tree.
2. The `maxDepth` function uses a recursive approach:
   - If the current node is None, we return 0 (base case).
   - Otherwise, we recursively calculate the depth of the left and right subtrees.
   - We return the maximum of the left and right depths, plus 1 for the current node.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
Space Complexity: O(h) in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be O(n).

Solution 2: Iterative Depth-First Search (DFS) using a stack

This solution uses an iterative approach with a stack to perform DFS.

```python
from typing import Optional
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        stack = deque([(root, 1)])  # Use a deque as a stack for better performance
        max_depth = 0

        while stack:
            node, depth = stack.pop()

            # Update max_depth if current depth is greater
            max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)

            # Add right child first, then left (to process left first when popping)
            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, depth + 1))
            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, depth + 1))

        return max_depth

# Test cases
def test_max_depth():
    # Test case 1: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    root1 = TreeNode(3)
    root1.left = TreeNode(9)
    root1.right = TreeNode(20)
    root1.right.left = TreeNode(15)
    root1.right.right = TreeNode(7)

    # Test case 2: [1,null,2]
    root2 = TreeNode(1)
    root2.right = TreeNode(2)

    solution = Solution()
    assert solution.maxDepth(root1) == 3, "Test case 1 failed"
    assert solution.maxDepth(root2) == 2, "Test case 2 failed"
    print("All test cases passed!")

test_max_depth()

```

Explanation:

1. We use a stack (implemented with a `deque` for better performance) to keep track of nodes and their depths.
2. We start with the root node and its depth (1).
3. While the stack is not empty:
   - Pop a node and its depth from the stack.
   - Update the max_depth if the current depth is greater.
   - Add the right child first, then the left child (if they exist) to the stack, incrementing their depth.
4. Return the maximum depth found.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
Space Complexity: O(h) in the average case, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case of a completely unbalanced tree, this could be O(n).

Solution 3: Breadth-First Search (BFS) using a queue

This solution uses BFS to traverse the tree level by level.

```python
from typing import Optional
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        queue = deque([root])
        depth = 0

        while queue:
            depth += 1
            level_size = len(queue)

            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = queue.popleft()

                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)

        return depth

# Test cases
def test_max_depth():
    # Test case 1: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    root1 = TreeNode(3)
    root1.left = TreeNode(9)
    root1.right = TreeNode(20)
    root1.right.left = TreeNode(15)
    root1.right.right = TreeNode(7)

    # Test case 2: [1,null,2]
    root2 = TreeNode(1)
    root2.right = TreeNode(2)

    solution = Solution()
    assert solution.maxDepth(root1) == 3, "Test case 1 failed"
    assert solution.maxDepth(root2) == 2, "Test case 2 failed"
    print("All test cases passed!")

test_max_depth()

```

Explanation:

1. We use a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree.
2. We keep track of the current depth and the number of nodes at each level.
3. For each level:
   - Increment the depth.
   - Process all nodes at the current level, adding their children to the queue.
4. The final depth is the maximum depth of the tree.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
Space Complexity: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case of a perfect binary tree, this could be O(n/2) = O(n) at the lowest level.

Recommendation:
For this problem, I would recommend learning the recursive DFS solution (Solution 1) first. It's the most intuitive and easiest to understand and implement. The recursive nature of the solution mirrors the recursive structure of the binary tree itself.

However, it's also valuable to understand the iterative approaches (Solutions 2 and 3):

- The iterative DFS (Solution 2) is useful for avoiding potential stack overflow issues with very deep trees.
- The BFS approach (Solution 3) can be more efficient for certain types of trees and provides a different perspective on tree traversal.

To help visualize these algorithms, let's create a simple diagram showing how they traverse the tree:

```

This visualization shows a binary tree and illustrates the order in which nodes are visited for both DFS (pre-order) and BFS (level-order) traversals. The DFS approach (used in Solutions 1 and 2) visits nodes depth-first, while the BFS approach (used in Solution 3) visits nodes level by level.

Understanding these traversal methods and their implications is crucial for solving tree-related problems efficiently. Each method has its strengths:

1. Recursive DFS (Solution 1): Simple and intuitive, directly reflects the tree structure.
2. Iterative DFS (Solution 2): Avoids recursion, useful for very deep trees.
3. BFS (Solution 3): Visits nodes level by level, useful when the solution is likely to be found in the upper levels of the tree.

For the "Maximum Depth of Binary Tree" problem, all three solutions perform equally well in terms of time complexity. The choice between them often comes down to personal preference, the specific constraints of the problem (e.g., stack limitations), and the structure of the input tree.
