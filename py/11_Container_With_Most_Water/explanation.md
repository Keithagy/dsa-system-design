## Explanation: Container With Most Water

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is a classic example of the "Two Pointers" pattern, which is often used in array-based problems. The key insight here is that we're looking for the maximum area, which is determined by two factors: the width between two lines and the height of the shorter line.

The problem's characteristics that lead us to this solution:

1. We're dealing with an array where the index represents the x-coordinate.
2. We need to find two elements (heights) that maximize the area between them.
3. The area is calculated as the minimum of the two heights multiplied by the distance between them.

The key principle that makes this question simple is the realization that we can start with the widest possible container (using the first and last elements) and then systematically move inwards, always moving the pointer that points to the shorter line. This approach guarantees that we don't miss the optimal solution because:

1. If we move the pointer with the taller height, we might decrease the width without any chance of increasing the height (as the height is limited by the shorter line).
2. By moving the shorter height pointer, we at least have a chance of finding a taller line that could increase the area, despite the decreased width.

This problem also teaches an important lesson about greedy algorithms: sometimes, making the locally optimal choice at each step leads to the globally optimal solution.

### Test cases

1. Regular case: `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]` (Expected output: 49)
2. All same height: `[5,5,5,5,5]` (Expected output: 20)
3. Ascending order: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` (Expected output: 8)
4. Descending order: `[6,5,4,3,2,1]` (Expected output: 8)
5. Two elements: `[1,1]` (Expected output: 1)
6. Large difference in heights: `[1,1000,1000,1]` (Expected output: 3)
7. Single high peak: `[1,2,100,2,1]` (Expected output: 4)

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def container_with_most_water(height: List[int]) -> int:
    # Implementation will go here
    pass

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    ([1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7], 49),
    ([5,5,5,5,5], 20),
    ([1,2,3,4,5,6], 8),
    ([6,5,4,3,2,1], 8),
    ([1,1], 1),
    ([1,1000,1000,1], 3),
    ([1,2,100,2,1], 4)
]

for i, (input_height, expected_output) in enumerate(test_cases):
    result = container_with_most_water(input_height)
    print(f"Test case {i+1}: {'Passed' if result == expected_output else 'Failed'}")
    print(f"Input: {input_height}")
    print(f"Expected: {expected_output}, Got: {result}\n")
```

### Solutions

#### Overview of solution approaches

##### Solutions worth learning

1. Two Pointer Approach (Optimal)
2. Brute Force Approach (For understanding)

Count: 2 solutions

##### Rejected solutions

1. Sorting-based approaches: Sorting would lose the crucial positional information.
2. Dynamic Programming: While it might seem tempting due to the "optimal substructure" feel of the problem, it's not necessary and would be less efficient than the two-pointer approach.

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Two Pointer Approach

```python
from typing import List

def container_with_most_water(height: List[int]) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0

    while left < right:
        # Calculate the current area
        width = right - left
        current_area = width * min(height[left], height[right])

        # Update max_area if necessary
        max_area = max(max_area, current_area)

        # Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    return max_area
```

Runtime Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the height array.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Intuitions and invariants:

- We start with the widest possible container and progressively narrow it down.
- At each step, we move the pointer that points to the shorter line.
- This approach ensures we don't miss the optimal solution because:
  - Moving the taller line can only decrease the area (due to reduced width and no potential height increase).
  - Moving the shorter line gives us a chance to find a taller line that could increase the area.
- The algorithm maintains the invariant that the maximum area encountered so far is always stored in `max_area`.

##### Brute Force Approach

```python
from typing import List

def container_with_most_water_brute_force(height: List[int]) -> int:
    max_area = 0
    n = len(height)

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            # Calculate the area between lines i and j
            width = j - i
            current_area = width * min(height[i], height[j])

            # Update max_area if necessary
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)

    return max_area
```

Runtime Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the height array.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Intuitions and invariants:

- This approach checks all possible pairs of lines.
- It's guaranteed to find the optimal solution by exhaustive search.
- While not efficient for large inputs, it's useful for understanding the problem and verifying the correctness of more efficient solutions.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Sorting-based approach: Sorting the array would lose the crucial positional information needed to calculate the width between lines.

2. Dynamic Programming: While it might seem tempting due to the "optimal substructure" feel of the problem, a DP approach would be less efficient (likely O(n^2) time and O(n^2) space) and more complex than the two-pointer solution.

3. Greedy approach always choosing the tallest lines: This wouldn't work because the optimal solution might involve lines that aren't the tallest, but are far apart.

#### Final Recommendations

The Two Pointer Approach is definitely the best solution to learn for this problem. It's optimal in both time (O(n)) and space (O(1)) complexity, and it demonstrates a powerful problem-solving technique that can be applied to many array-based problems. Understanding this solution will improve your ability to recognize and solve similar problems in the future.

The Brute Force approach, while not optimal, is worth understanding conceptually as it helps in verifying the correctness of the optimal solution and can be a good starting point in problem-solving when you're stuck.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the Two Pointer approach, let's create a simple React component that demonstrates how the algorithm works step-by-step:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const ContainerWithMostWater = () => {
  const [heights, setHeights] = useState([1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]);
  const [left, setLeft] = useState(0);
  const [right, setRight] = useState(heights.length - 1);
  const [maxArea, setMaxArea] = useState(0);
  const [currentArea, setCurrentArea] = useState(0);
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (left < right) {
      const width = right - left;
      const area = width * Math.min(heights[left], heights[right]);
      setCurrentArea(area);
      setMaxArea(Math.max(maxArea, area));
    }
  }, [left, right, heights, maxArea]);

  const nextStep = () => {
    if (left < right) {
      if (heights[left] < heights[right]) {
        setLeft(left + 1);
      } else {
        setRight(right - 1);
      }
      setStep(step + 1);
    }
  };

  const reset = () => {
    setLeft(0);
    setRight(heights.length - 1);
    setMaxArea(0);
    setCurrentArea(0);
    setStep(0);
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
        Container With Most Water Visualization
      </h2>
      <div className="flex items-end h-64 mb-4 border-b border-gray-300">
        {heights.map((height, index) => (
          <div
            key={index}
            className={`w-8 mr-1 ${
              index === left || index === right ? "bg-blue-500" : "bg-gray-300"
            }`}
            style={{ height: `${height * 8}px` }}
          ></div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div className="mb-4">
        <p>Step: {step}</p>
        <p>Current Area: {currentArea}</p>
        <p>Max Area: {maxArea}</p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex gap-2">
        <button
          className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
          onClick={nextStep}
          disabled={left >= right}
        >
          Next Step
        </button>
        <button
          className="bg-gray-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
          onClick={reset}
        >
          Reset
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ContainerWithMostWater;
```

This visualization shows how the two pointers move inwards, calculating the area at each step and keeping track of the maximum area found. The blue bars represent the current left and right pointers. You can step through the algorithm to see how it progresses and how the maximum area is updated.
