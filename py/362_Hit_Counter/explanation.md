## Explanation: Design Hit Counter

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is about designing a data structure that efficiently tracks and retrieves hit counts within a specific time window. The key characteristics of this problem are:

1. Time-based data: We're dealing with timestamps in seconds.
2. Fixed window: We need to consider hits within the last 300 seconds (5 minutes).
3. Chronological order: Timestamps are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.
4. Multiple hits: Several hits can occur at the same timestamp.
5. Two operations: Recording hits and retrieving hit counts.

The core principle that makes this question simple is the sliding window concept. We only need to maintain data for the last 300 seconds, and we can leverage the chronological order of inputs to efficiently update and clean our data structure.

This problem falls into the category of time-based data structures and queue-based sliding window problems. The fixed time window and chronological order of inputs allow for optimizations in both time and space complexity.

### Test cases

1. Basic functionality:

   - Record hits at timestamps 1, 2, 3
   - Get hits at timestamp 4 (should return 3)
   - Record hit at timestamp 300
   - Get hits at timestamp 300 (should return 4)
   - Get hits at timestamp 301 (should return 3)

2. Edge cases:

   - Get hits immediately after initialization (should return 0)
   - Record multiple hits at the same timestamp
   - Get hits exactly 300 seconds after the first hit
   - Get hits long after the last recorded hit (should return 0)

3. Stress test:
   - Record 300 hits at consecutive timestamps
   - Get hits at various points during and after these recordings

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def test_hit_counter():
    hc = HitCounter()

    # Basic functionality
    hc.hit(1)
    hc.hit(2)
    hc.hit(3)
    assert hc.getHits(4) == 3
    hc.hit(300)
    assert hc.getHits(300) == 4
    assert hc.getHits(301) == 3

    # Edge cases
    hc = HitCounter()
    assert hc.getHits(1) == 0
    hc.hit(1)
    hc.hit(1)
    hc.hit(1)
    assert hc.getHits(1) == 3
    hc.hit(2)
    assert hc.getHits(302) == 1
    assert hc.getHits(10000) == 0

    # Stress test
    hc = HitCounter()
    for i in range(300):
        hc.hit(i + 1)
    assert hc.getHits(300) == 300
    assert hc.getHits(599) == 300
    assert hc.getHits(600) == 1
    assert hc.getHits(601) == 0

    print("All tests passed!")

test_hit_counter()
```

### Solutions

#### Overview of solution approaches

##### Solutions worth learning

1. Queue-based approach (Neetcode solution)
2. Circular buffer approach
3. Bucketing approach (Neetcode solution)

Count: 3 solutions (2 Neetcode solutions)

##### Rejected solutions

1. Naive array/list approach: Storing all timestamps and counting them on each getHits call would be inefficient for large numbers of hits.
2. Hash table approach: While it could work, it doesn't take full advantage of the chronological nature of the inputs and could be memory-intensive.

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Queue-based approach (Neetcode solution)

```python
from collections import deque

class HitCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hits = deque()

    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        self.hits.append(timestamp)

    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        while self.hits and timestamp - self.hits[0] >= 300:
            self.hits.popleft()
        return len(self.hits)
```

Time complexity:

- hit: O(1) - Appending to a deque is a constant time operation.
- getHits: O(k), where k is the number of outdated hits to remove. In the worst case, this could be all hits, but on average, it's much less.

Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of hits in the last 300 seconds.

Intuitions and invariants:

- The queue always maintains hits in chronological order.
- Outdated hits are removed lazily during getHits calls.
- The length of the queue after cleaning represents the number of valid hits.

This solution leverages the chronological nature of the input to maintain a simple yet effective data structure. The deque allows for efficient appending of new hits and removal of old hits from the front.

##### Circular buffer approach

```python
class HitCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.times = [0] * 300
        self.hits = [0] * 300

    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        index = timestamp % 300
        if self.times[index] != timestamp:
            self.times[index] = timestamp
            self.hits[index] = 1
        else:
            self.hits[index] += 1

    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        for i in range(300):
            if timestamp - self.times[i] < 300:
                total += self.hits[i]
        return total
```

Time complexity:

- hit: O(1) - Constant time operation to update a single index.
- getHits: O(1) - Always iterates over 300 elements, regardless of the number of hits.

Space complexity: O(1) - Uses fixed-size arrays of 300 elements.

Intuitions and invariants:

- Uses the modulo operation to map timestamps to array indices, creating a circular buffer.
- Overwrites old data when the same index is revisited after 300 seconds.
- Maintains a separate array for hit counts to handle multiple hits at the same timestamp.

This approach cleverly uses the fixed time window to create a space-efficient solution. It's particularly effective when the hit frequency is high, as it doesn't store individual hit timestamps.

##### Bucketing approach (Neetcode solution)

```python
class HitCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buckets = [[0, 0] for _ in range(300)]  # [timestamp, count]

    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        index = timestamp % 300
        if self.buckets[index][0] != timestamp:
            self.buckets[index] = [timestamp, 1]
        else:
            self.buckets[index][1] += 1

    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        for i in range(300):
            bucket_time, count = self.buckets[i]
            if timestamp - bucket_time < 300:
                total += count
        return total
```

Time complexity:

- hit: O(1) - Constant time operation to update a single bucket.
- getHits: O(1) - Always iterates over 300 buckets, regardless of the number of hits.

Space complexity: O(1) - Uses a fixed-size array of 300 buckets.

Intuitions and invariants:

- Divides the 300-second window into 300 one-second buckets.
- Each bucket stores the latest timestamp and the count of hits for that second.
- Automatically handles cleaning of old data by overwriting buckets.

This solution combines the benefits of the circular buffer approach with the ability to handle multiple hits per second more explicitly. It's a good balance between time and space efficiency.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Naive array/list approach: Storing every hit timestamp in an array and counting them on each getHits call would be O(n) time for getHits, where n is the number of hits. This becomes inefficient for a large number of hits.

2. Hash table approach: While it could work by storing timestamps as keys and hit counts as values, it doesn't take full advantage of the chronological nature of the inputs. It could also be memory-intensive if there are many unique timestamps.

#### Final Recommendations

The bucketing approach (Neetcode solution) is the best to learn for this problem. It offers:

1. Constant time complexity for both hit and getHits operations.
2. Constant space complexity, regardless of the number of hits.
3. Elegant handling of multiple hits per second.
4. Automatic cleaning of old data.

This solution scales well for high-frequency hits and provides a good balance of time and space efficiency. It's also relatively simple to understand and implement, making it an excellent choice for coding interviews.

### Visualization(s)

For the bucketing approach, we can visualize it as a circular array of 300 buckets:

````
```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const HitCounterVisualization = () => {
  const [buckets, setBuckets] = useState(Array(300).fill([0, 0]));
  const [currentTime, setCurrentTime] = useState(0);

  const hit = (timestamp) => {
    setBuckets(prevBuckets => {
      const newBuckets = [...prevBuckets];
      const index = timestamp % 300;
      if (newBuckets[index][0] !== timestamp) {
        newBuckets[index] = [timestamp, 1];
      } else {
        newBuckets[index] = [timestamp, newBuckets[index][1] + 1];
      }
      return newBuckets;
    });
    setCurrentTime(timestamp);
  };

  const getHits = (timestamp) => {
    return buckets.reduce((total, [bucketTime, count]) => {
      if (timestamp - bucketTime < 300) {
        return total + count;
      }
      return total;
    }, 0);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate some hits
    [1, 2, 3, 300, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304].forEach(hit);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Hit Counter Visualization</h2>
      <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
        {buckets.map(([timestamp, count], index) => (
          <div
            key={index}
            className={`w-8 h-8 flex items-center justify-center border ${
              currentTime - timestamp < 300 ? 'bg-blue-200' : 'bg-gray-200'
            }`}
            title={`Timestamp: ${timestamp}, Count: ${count}`}
          >
            {count > 0 ? count : ''}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <p className="mt-4">Current time: {currentTime}</p>
      <p>Hits in last 5 minutes: {getHits(currentTime)}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HitCounterVisualization;

````

```

This visualization shows the 300 buckets as a grid. Each cell represents a second, with the number in the cell indicating the hit count for that second. Blue cells are within the last 300 seconds, while gray cells are older. This helps illustrate how the bucketing approach efficiently manages the sliding window of hits.
```
