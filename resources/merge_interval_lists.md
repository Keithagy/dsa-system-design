## Explanation: Merge Two Non-Overlapping Interval Lists

### Analysis of problem & input data

This problem is a variation of the classic "merge intervals" problem, with a twist that we're dealing with two pre-sorted, non-overlapping interval lists. The key characteristics to note are:

1. Each input list (A and B) is already sorted and has no internal overlaps.
2. We need to merge these lists efficiently, producing a final sorted list with no overlaps.

The key principle that makes this question simpler than a general "merge intervals" problem is that we can leverage the pre-sorted, non-overlapping nature of the input lists. This allows us to use a two-pointer approach, similar to the merge step in merge sort, which can be done in linear time.

The pattern-matching here is to recognize that we can perform a single-pass merge of two sorted lists, with additional logic to handle interval merging. This is more efficient than concatenating the lists and re-sorting, which would be O(n log n).

### Test cases

Let's consider the following test cases:

1. The given example:
   A: [[1,5], [10,14], [16,18]]
   B: [[2,6], [8,10], [11,20]]
   Expected output: [[1,6], [8,20]]

2. No overlap between A and B:
   A: [[1,3], [5,7]]
   B: [[2,4], [6,8]]
   Expected output: [[1,3], [2,4], [5,7], [6,8]]

3. One list entirely within the other:
   A: [[1,10]]
   B: [[2,3], [4,5], [6,7]]
   Expected output: [[1,10]]

4. Empty list:
   A: []
   B: [[1,2], [3,4]]
   Expected output: [[1,2], [3,4]]

5. Identical intervals:
   A: [[1,2], [3,4]]
   B: [[1,2], [3,4]]
   Expected output: [[1,2], [3,4]]

Here's the Python code for these test cases:

```python
def merge_intervals(A, B):
    # Implementation will go here
    pass

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (
        [[1,5], [10,14], [16,18]],
        [[2,6], [8,10], [11,20]],
        [[1,6], [8,20]]
    ),
    (
        [[1,3], [5,7]],
        [[2,4], [6,8]],
        [[1,3], [2,4], [5,7], [6,8]]
    ),
    (
        [[1,10]],
        [[2,3], [4,5], [6,7]],
        [[1,10]]
    ),
    (
        [],
        [[1,2], [3,4]],
        [[1,2], [3,4]]
    ),
    (
        [[1,2], [3,4]],
        [[1,2], [3,4]],
        [[1,2], [3,4]]
    )
]

for i, (A, B, expected) in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
    result = merge_intervals(A, B)
    print(f"Test case {i}: {'Passed' if result == expected else 'Failed'}")
    if result != expected:
        print(f"  Expected: {expected}")
        print(f"  Got: {result}")
```

#### Worthy Solutions

##### Two-pointer approach with merging

```python
from typing import List

def merge_intervals(A: List[List[int]], B: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    n, m = len(A), len(B)

    def merge(interval: List[int]) -> None:
        if not result or result[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            result.append(interval)
        else:
            result[-1][1] = max(result[-1][1], interval[1])

    while i < n and j < m:
        # Compare start times of intervals from A and B
        if A[i][0] <= B[j][0]:
            merge(A[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merge(B[j])
            j += 1

    # Handle remaining intervals in A or B
    while i < n:
        merge(A[i])
        i += 1
    while j < m:
        merge(B[j])
        j += 1

    return result
```

Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of A and B respectively.
Space Complexity: O(n + m) in the worst case, where the result contains all intervals.

Explanation:

- We iterate through both lists simultaneously, always choosing the interval with the earlier start time.
- The `merge` function handles the logic of either adding a new interval or extending the last interval in the result.
- This approach leverages the fact that both input lists are already sorted and non-overlapping internally.

Key intuitions and invariants:

- The result list is always maintained in sorted order.
- We only need to compare with the last interval in the result list for potential merging.
- By processing intervals in order of start time, we ensure we don't miss any overlaps.

##### Priority queue approach

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

def merge_intervals(A: List[List[int]], B: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    # Create a min-heap of all intervals, sorted by start time
    heap = [(interval[0], interval, list_id) for list_id, intervals in enumerate([A, B]) for interval in intervals]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    while heap:
        _, interval, _ = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if not result or result[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            result.append(interval)
        else:
            result[-1][1] = max(result[-1][1], interval[1])

    return result
```

Time Complexity: O((n + m) log(n + m)), where n and m are the lengths of A and B respectively.
Space Complexity: O(n + m) for the heap and the result list.

Explanation:

- We use a min-heap to always process the interval with the earliest start time next.
- This approach generalizes well if we had more than two lists to merge.
- The heap operations (push and pop) take O(log(n + m)) time, and we do this for each interval.

Key intuitions and invariants:

- The heap ensures we always process intervals in order of start time, regardless of which list they came from.
- This approach would work even if the input lists weren't sorted (though in this case, it's slightly less efficient than the two-pointer approach).

##### Line sweep algorithm

```python
from typing import List

def merge_intervals(A: List[List[int]], B: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    events = []
    for start, end in A + B:
        events.append((start, 0))  # 0 indicates start of an interval
        events.append((end, 1))    # 1 indicates end of an interval

    events.sort()  # Sort all events by their time

    result = []
    open_count = 0
    start = None

    for time, event_type in events:
        if event_type == 0:  # Start of an interval
            if open_count == 0:
                start = time
            open_count += 1
        else:  # End of an interval
            open_count -= 1
            if open_count == 0:
                result.append([start, time])

    return result
```

Time Complexity: O((n + m) log(n + m)) due to sorting the events.
Space Complexity: O(n + m) for storing all events and the result.

Explanation:

- We convert intervals into events (start and end points).
- We sweep through all events in order, keeping track of how many intervals are "open" at any time.
- When the open count goes from 0 to 1, we start a new merged interval.
- When it goes from 1 to 0, we close the current merged interval.

Key intuitions and invariants:

- Any time the open count is positive, we're inside at least one interval.
- This approach works well for visualizing the merging process and generalizes to more complex interval problems.

#### Rejected Approaches

1. Concatenate and sort approach:

   - Concatenate A and B, sort the result, then merge overlapping intervals.
   - Time complexity: O((n + m) log(n + m)) due to sorting.
   - Rejected because it doesn't leverage the pre-sorted nature of the input lists.

2. Recursive divide-and-conquer:
   - Recursively divide the lists and merge the results.
   - Overcomplicated for this problem, doesn't leverage the pre-sorted nature of inputs.
   - Time complexity would be O((n + m) log(n + m)), not improving upon simpler solutions.

#### Final Recommendations

The two-pointer approach is recommended as the best solution to learn for this problem. It's the most efficient (O(n + m) time complexity), uses minimal extra space, and directly leverages the pre-sorted, non-overlapping nature of the input lists. It's also relatively simple to implement and understand, making it an excellent choice for coding interviews.

The priority queue and line sweep approaches are worth understanding as they generalize well to more complex interval problems, but for this specific problem, they're slightly overkill.

### Visualization(s)

To visualize the two-pointer approach, we can use a simple ASCII art representation:

```
A: |---| |----| |--|
B:  |---| |-| |-------|
     ^     ^
     i     j

Result: |----| |-| |-------|
```

This visualization shows how we compare intervals from A and B, always choosing the one with the earlier start time, and merging when necessary. The pointers i and j move through the lists A and B respectively.

import React, { useState } from "react";

const IntervalMergeVisualization = () => {

  const steps = [
    { result: [], i: 0, j: 0 },
    { result: [[1, 5]], i: 1, j: 0 },
    { result: [[1, 6]], i: 1, j: 1 },
    {
      result: [

      j: 3,
    },
  ];

  const renderInterval = (interval, color) => (
    <div
      style={{

        backgroundColor: color,
        border: "1px solid black",

    />

      <div style={{ position: "absolute", top: "120px" }}>
        <button onClick={() => setStep(Math.max(0, step - 1))}>Previous</button>
        <button onClick={() => setStep(Math.min(steps.length - 1, step + 1))}>

  );
};

export default IntervalMergeVisualization;

This React component provides an interactive visualization of the interval merging process. The top row represents list A, the middle row represents list B, and the bottom row shows the merged result as it's being built. You can step through the process to see how intervals are merged.
