Certainly, I'll provide you with a Python implementation of the quicksort algorithm and then explain how it works.

```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    else:
        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
        middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
        return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unsorted_list = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
    sorted_list = quicksort(unsorted_list)
    print("Unsorted list:", unsorted_list)
    print("Sorted list:", sorted_list)

```

Now, let me explain how the quicksort algorithm works:

1. Base case: If the input array has 1 or fewer elements, it's already sorted, so we return it as is.

2. Choosing a pivot: We select a pivot element. In this implementation, we choose the middle element of the array, but other strategies (like choosing the first or last element) can also be used.

3. Partitioning: We divide the array into three parts:

   - Left: All elements smaller than the pivot
   - Middle: All elements equal to the pivot
   - Right: All elements larger than the pivot

4. Recursion: We recursively apply the quicksort algorithm to the left and right partitions.

5. Combining: We combine the sorted left partition, the middle elements, and the sorted right partition to get the final sorted array.

The key idea behind quicksort is the partitioning step, which puts elements in roughly the right place. By recursively applying this process to smaller and smaller subarrays, we eventually sort the entire array.

Quicksort is known for its efficiency, with an average time complexity of O(n log n). However, in the worst case (when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element), it can degrade to O(n^2).

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the algorithm or its implementation?
